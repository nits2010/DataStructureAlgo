# Pattern 7: Tree Breadth First Search

This pattern is based on the <b>Breadth First Search (BFS)</b> technique to traverse a tree.

Any problem involving the traversal of a tree in a level-by-level order can be efficiently solved using this approach. We will use a <b>Queue</b> to keep track of all the nodes of a level before we jump onto the next level. This also means that the space complexity of the algorithm will be `O(W)`, where `W` is the maximum number of nodes on any level.


## Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (easy)
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/

> Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its level-by-level traversal. You should populate the values of all <b>nodes of each level from left to right</b> in separate sub-arrays.

Since we need to traverse all nodes of each level before moving onto the next level, we can use the <b>Breadth First Search (BFS)</b> technique to solve this problem.

We can use a <b>Queue</b> to efficiently traverse in <b>BFS</b> fashion. Here are the steps of our algorithm:
1. Start by pushing the `root` node to the queue.
2. Keep iterating until the <b>queue</b> is empty.
3. In each iteration, first count the elements in the <b>queue</b> (letâ€™s call it `levelSize`). We will have these many nodes in the current level.
4. Next, remove `levelSize` nodes from the <b>queue</b> and push their `value` in an array to represent the current level.
5. After removing each node from the queue, insert both of its children into the queue.
6. If the <b>queue</b> is not empty, repeat from <i>step 3</i> for the next level.

- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. We will also need `O(N)` space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of `N/2` nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(N)` space to store them in the queue.

- The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)`, which is required for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of `N/2`nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(N)` space to store them in the queue.

## ðŸŒŸ Connect All Level Order Siblings (medium) 
> Given a binary tree, connect each node with its level order successor. The last node of each level should point to the first node of the next level.

This problem follows the <b>Binary Tree Level Order Traversal</b> pattern. We can follow the same <b>BFS</b> approach. The only difference will be that while traversing we will remember (irrespective of the level) the previous node to connect it with the current node.

class TreeNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;

  }
  
  // tree traversal using 'next' pointer
  printTree() {
    let result = "Traversal using 'next' pointer: ";
    let current = this;
    while (current != null) {
      result += current.value + " ";
      current = current.next;
    }
    console.log(result);
  }
};

  const queue = [root]
  let currentNode = null
  let previousNode = null

      previousNode.next = currentNode
    }

      queue.push(currentNode.left)
    }

      queue.push(currentNode.right)
    }

- The space complexity of the above algorithm will be `O(N)` as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. We will also need `O(N)` space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of `N/2` nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need `O(N)` space to store them in the queue.

We will be following a similar approach, but instead of appending the last element of each level, we will be appending the first element of each level to the output array.

````js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value
    this.left = null
    this.right = null
  }
}

function treeRightView(root) {
  let result = [];
  
  if(root === null) {
    return result
  }
  
  const queue = [root]
  
  while(queue.length > 0) {
    let levelSize = queue.length
    
    for(let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
      let currentNode = queue.shift()
      
      //if it is the first node of this level,
      //add it to the result
      if(i === 0){
        result.push(currentNode.value)
      }
      //insert the children of current node in the queue
      if(currentNode.left !== null) {
        queue.push(currentNode.left)
      }
      if(currentNode.right !== null) {
