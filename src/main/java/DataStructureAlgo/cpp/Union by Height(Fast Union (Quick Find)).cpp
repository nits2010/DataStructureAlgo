//Quick Union : Union by Height
/* In Union by Height : Make the Smaller Tree (height wise ) as a SubTree of the larger Tree*/
/* Algo: implementing using Array
Create a Height array which contain the Height of the Tree Rooted at that point

   Find_Algo : from the Given root find its root by moving upword
   Union_Algo: 1. First find the Root of both "a" and "b" say "root1" and "root2"
               2. Then find the Minimum Height Tree and connect it with larger size tree

                 Height updation procedure :
                 ---------------------------------
                        1. if  the height of both tree is 1 then update the height of root node to 2
                        2. if the height of the both tree are equal
                                then increment the height of the root node tree by 1
                                                [since if we connect a "X" height tree to "X" height tree then Height of the total tree will be "X+1"]
                            if the height of the both tree are not equal
                                        then by adding the tree of smaller height to Tree of Larger height
                                        does not effect on the height of total tree


    Complexity:   Union     Find
         Average    O(logN)     O(logN)
         Worst      O( (logN)^2 )  O(logN)

                                    N being the size of data
