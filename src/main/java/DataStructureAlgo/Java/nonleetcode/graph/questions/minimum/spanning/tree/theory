What is Minimum Spanning Tree?
Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together.
A single graph can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted,
connected and undirected graph is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree.
The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.

How many edges does a minimum spanning tree has?
A minimum spanning tree has (V – 1) edges where V is the number of vertices in the given graph.
