 * <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bellman-ford-algorithm-dp-23/">...</a>
 * <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/4811631/Bellman-Ford-Algorithm">...</a>
 * <p>
 * Given a graph and a source vertex src in graph, find the shortest paths from src to all vertices in the given graph. The graph may contain negative weight edges.
 * We have discussed Dijkstra’s algorithm for this problem. {@link DijkstraShortestPath} algorithm is a Greedy algorithm and time complexity is O(VLogV) (with the use of Fibonacci heap).
 * {@link DijkstraShortestPath} does’t work for Graphs with negative weight edges, Bellman-Ford works for such graphs. Bellman-Ford is also simpler than {@link DijkstraShortestPath} and suites well
 * for distributed systems. But time complexity of Bellman-Ford is O(VE), which is more than Dijkstra.
 * <p>
 * Algorithm:
 * 1) This step initializes distances from source to all vertices as infinite and distance to source itself as 0.
 * Create an array dist[] of size |V| with all values as infinite except dist[src] where src is source vertex.
 * <p>
 * 2) This step calculates shortest distances. Do the following |V|-1 times when |V| is the number of vertices in the given graph.
 * …..a) Do following for each edge u-v
 * ………………If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then update dist[v]
 * ………………….dist[v] = dist[u] + weight of edge uv
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(V*E)
