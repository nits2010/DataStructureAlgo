 * Description: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/350312/google-onsite-interesting-string
 * Given a string s consisting of digits 0-9 and lowercase English letters a-z.
 * <p>
 * A string is interesting if you can split it into several substrings, such that each substring starts with a number and this number represents the number of characters after it. Retrun true if string s is intersting, otherwise false.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: "4g12y6hunter"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: We can split it into "4g12y" and "6hunter".
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: "124gray6hunter"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: We can divide it into "12", "4gray", "6hunter".
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: "31ba2a"
 * Output: false

/**
 * Approach: [Fails]
 * As the first thought comes in mind, is to traverse from back and count characters. As soon you hit a digit,
 * check does this digits is equal to the count of character, if so then simply remove this part and now problem reduce to
 * the remaining string
 * Lets take an example:
 * "124gray6hunter"
 * We counted "hunter" (6) and we hit a digit and we check does this equal to the count so far, which is true for this Then
 * Now it becomes "124gray"
 * We count "gray" (4) and hit 4 and equal so Now
 * Now it becomes "12", we hit first as digit only, so we look back more (either assume this is a character or a digit)
 * In case of character this result true because "12" says there is 1 character after this which true.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Now but this does not take the consideration when all of the character are converge at the start of string.
 * Lets take an example:
 * "169aaaaaaaaaaa3zyx" -> "169aaaaaaaaaaa"
 * We counted "aaaaaaaaaaa" (11) and next is 9 < 11, so we try to make a bigger number by joining... which is
 * now 69 > 11 ; hence we'll consider 9 as character it self, so we left with count=12 and "16" since 6 < 12 so we'll try to make
 * bigger number caused it to 16 > 12 and here string ends. Result "False"
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Correction in above approach:
 * The problem we had in above approach is we don't know where to stop to make it work. Where we should say
 * that current value should be taken as "digit" or 'character'. Hence we need to try both of them.
 * <p>
 * So we can recursively try and find, Leads to Simple Backtracking.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Backtracking
 * <p>
 * Our Goal: Our goal is to divide the given string in multiple chunks s.t. each of them is individually forming correct string. If we can, then TRUE otherwise False
 * Our Constraints: We can't consume more character then given in string
 * Our Choices: choose each element, either assume as digit ( if it really a digit) otherwise makr it as character and try for remaining part.
 * <p>
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Check does current character is a digit, if so, skip that many character in
 * 2. Check remaining string is follow the rule
 * 3. if Yes: True Otherwise
 * 4. Go back and try to build a bigger number (if digits are consecutive to each other) and try again.
