 * Description: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-minimum-possible-size-of-array-with-given-rules-for-removal/
 * <p>
 * Given an array of numbers and a constant k, minimize size of array with following rules for removing elements.
 * <p>
 * Exactly three elements can be removed at one go.
 * The removed three elements must be adjacent in array, i.e., arr[i], arr[i+1], arr[i+2]. And the second element must be k greater than first and third element must be k greater than second, i.e., arr[i+1] – arr[i] = k and arr[i+2]-arr[i+1] = k.
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Input: arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4}, k = 1
 * Output: 0
 * We can actually remove all elements.
 * First remove 4, 5, 6 => We get {2, 3, 4}
 * Now remove 2, 3, 4   => We get empty array {}
 * <p>
 * Input:  arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 7, 6, 4}, k = 1
 * Output: 3
 * We can only remove 2 3 4
