 * Description: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/an-in-place-algorithm-for-string-transformation/
 * Given a string, move all even positioned elements to end of string. While moving elements, keep the relative order of all even positioned
 * and odd positioned elements same. For example, if the given string is “a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j1k2l3m4”,
 * convert it to “abcdefghijklm1234567891234” in-place and in O(n) time complexity.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Below are the steps:
 * <p>
 * 1. Cut out the largest prefix sub-string of size of the form 3^k + 1. In this step, we find the largest non-negative integer k such
 * that 3^k+1 is smaller than or equal to n (length of string)
 * <p>
 * 2. Apply cycle leader iteration algorithm ( it has been discussed below ), starting with index 1, 3, 9…… to this sub-string.
 * Cycle leader iteration algorithm moves all the items of this sub-string to their correct positions, i.e. all the alphabets are shifted to the
 * left half of the sub-string and all the digits are shifted to the right half of this sub-string.
 * <p>
 * 3. Process the remaining sub-string recursively using steps#1 and #2.
 * <p>
 * 4. Now, we only need to join the processed sub-strings together. Start from any end ( say from left ), pick two sub-strings and apply the
 * below steps:
 * <p>
 * ….4.1 Reverse the second half of first sub-string.
 * ….4.2 Reverse the first half of second sub-string.
 * ….4.3 Reverse the second half of first sub-string and first half of second sub-string together.
 * <p>
 * 5. Repeat step#4 until all sub-strings are joined. It is similar to k-way merging where first sub-string is joined with second. The resultant
 * is merged with third and so on.
