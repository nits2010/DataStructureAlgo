 * O(1) solution https://leetcode.com/articles/4-keys-keyboard/
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Below is the problem statement.
 * <p>
 * Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys:
 * Key 1:  Prints 'A' on screen
 * Key 2: (Ctrl-A): Select screen
 * Key 3: (Ctrl-C): Copy selection to buffer
 * Key 4: (Ctrl-V): Print buffer on screen appending it
 * after what has already been printed.
 * <p>
 * If you can only press the keyboard for N times (with the above four
 * keys), write a program to produce maximum numbers of A's. That is to
 * say, the input parameter is N (No. of keys that you can press), the
 * output is M (No. of As that you can produce).
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * Input:  N = 3
 * Output: 3
 * We can at most get 3 A's on screen by pressing
 * following key sequence.
 * A, A, A
 * <p>
 * Input:  N = 7
 * Output: 9
 * We can at most get 9 A's on screen by pressing
 * following key sequence.
 * A, A, A, Ctrl A, Ctrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl V
 * <p>
 * Input:  N = 11
 * Output: 27
 * We can at most get 27 A's on screen by pressing
 * following key sequence.
 * A, A, A, Ctrl A, Ctrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl V, Ctrl A,
 * Ctrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl V
