 * Description: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/chocolate-distribution-problem/
 * <p>
 * Given an array of n integers where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that:
 * <p>
 * 1. Each student gets one packet.
 * 2. The difference between the number of chocolates in packet with maximum chocolates and packet with minimum chocolates
 * given to the students is minimum.
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * Input : arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}
 * m = 3
 * Output: Minimum Difference is 2
 * We have seven packets of chocolates and
 * we need to pick three packets for 3 students
 * If we pick 2, 3 and 4, we get the minimum
 * difference between maximum and minimum packet
 * sizes.
 * <p>
 * Input : arr[] = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12}
 * m = 5
 * Output: Minimum Difference is 6
 * The set goes like 3,4,7,9,9 and the output
 * is 9-3 = 6
 * <p>
 * Input : arr[] = {12, 4, 7, 9, 2, 23, 25, 41,
 * 30, 40, 28, 42, 30, 44, 48,
 * 43, 50}
 * m = 7
 * Output: Minimum Difference is 10
 * We need to pick 7 packets. We pick 40, 41,
 * 42, 44, 48, 43 and 50 to minimize difference
 * between maximum and minimum.

     * Since, Each student gets one packet.
     * i.e. We need to divide the array in m set
     * <p>
     * And
     * The difference between the number of chocolates in packet with maximum chocolates and packet with minimum chocolates
     * given to the students is minimum.
     * There are two possibilities
     * <p>
     * 1. if number of chocolates = students ; Then the least difference is only 'max-min' ; as we have to give a packet to each student
     * and one student will have maximum number of chocolate packet while other one will have minimum number of chocolate packet.
     * <p>
     * 2. if number of chocolates > students ; then we need to give chocolates packets to each student in a way that max-min is Minimize.
     * To minimize, we can give m packets to m student such a way that student A will have X number of chocolate and Student B will have Y number of chocolates
     * and Y > X and Y-X is minimum.
     * In order to do that, we can give packets in sorted order of window m, and find the minimum difference in window elements.
