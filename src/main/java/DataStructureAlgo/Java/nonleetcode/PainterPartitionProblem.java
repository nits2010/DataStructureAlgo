 * Description: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/painters-partition-problem/
 * The painter’s partition problem
 * We have to paint n boards of length {A1, A2…An}. There are k painters available and each takes 1 unit time to paint 1 unit of board. The problem is to find the minimum time to get
 * this job done under the constraints that any painter will only paint continuous sections of boards, say board {2, 3, 4} or only board {1} or nothing but not board {2, 4, 5}.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * Input : k = 2, A = {10, 10, 10, 10}
 * Output : 20.
 * Here we can divide the boards into 2
 * equal sized partitions, so each painter
 * gets 20 units of board and the total
 * time taken is 20.
 * <p>
 * Input : k = 2, A = {10, 20, 30, 40}
 * Output : 60.
 * Here we can divide first 3 boards for
 * one painter and the last board for
 * second painter.
 * <p>
 * another variation: {@link DataStructureAlgo.Java.LeetCode.MinimizeMaxDistanceGasStation}

    /**
     * Let's understand the problem first;
     * we have n boards  { 10,20,30,40 } with k painters = 2;
     * these painters paint the board in
     * 1. contiguous manner only i.e. if painter x is painting from i ... j then he can paint j+1 but can't paint j+2 without painting j+1
     * We need to minimize the cost of painting with k painters; cost is determined by summing up the board size painted by painters
     * <p>
     * Approach:
     * if we see closely, then we can obtain below information
     * [ This is nothing but having a set of n elements, we need to divide this set into k sub-arrays{because they can paint in order} s.t. maximum sum of these set is overall minimize ]
     * [ solution for sub-set is S(n,k) = k*S(n-1,k) + S(n-1, k-1 ) , But here we need to find sub-arrays not sub-sets ]
     * <p>
     * now,  if we know what was the cost of painting n boards with k-1 painters, then we can calculate the cost of painting n boards with k painters.
     * To find, this new painter can paint the board(S) from anywhere in order. Just like putting the current element in k-1 subset, for that we need to try every subset.
     * <p>
     * Let's examine the cost with k=1
     * {10} k=1 => 10
     * {10, 20} k=1 => 10+20 = 30
     * {10, 20, 30} k=1 => 10+20+30 = 60
     * {10, 20, 30, 40} k=1 => 10+20+30+40= 100
     * <p>
     * now with k=2
     * {10} k=2 => 10
     * {10, 20} k=2 =>
     * *            => either
     * *                > {10} with k=1 , {20} =>{ { {10}, {20} }  or {10,20} , {} }
     * *                ....> first painter paint {10} and second paints {20} OR first painter paint {10,20} and second paint {}
     * *            =>  Min { MAx { {10}, {20} }  , Max {10,20} , {} } => Min(20,30) = 20
     * <p>
     * {10, 20, 30} k=2 =>  Min {60,30,50} = 30
     * * *            => either Max [ {10,20,30} , {} ] = 60
     * *            => either Max [ {10,20} , {30} ] = 30
     * *            => either Max [ {10} , {20,30} ] = 50
     * Which translates that with k-1 painter; from 1 board  { Max [ {10} , {20,30} ] } to n=3 board { either Max [ {10,20,30} , {} ]}
     * *                                                                     ^^^^^Remaining boards                                ^Remaining boards
