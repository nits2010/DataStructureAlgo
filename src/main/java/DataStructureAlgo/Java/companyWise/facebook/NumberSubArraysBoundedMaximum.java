 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-subarrays-with-bounded-maximum/
 * <p>
 * https://aonecode.com/aplusplus/interviewctrl/getInterview/7243247199135871999
 * We are given an array A of positive integers, and two positive integers L and R (L <= R).
 * <p>
 * Return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) sub-arrays such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is at least L and at most R.
 * <p>
 * Example :
 * Input:
 * A = [2, 1, 4, 3]
 * L = 2
 * R = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: There are three subarrays that meet the requirements: [2], [2, 1], [3].
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * L, R  and A[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
 * The length of A will be in the range of [1, 50000].
 * [FACEBOOK]

     * As we know we need to find the "sub-arrays", we need to keep track of it from where the sub-array start
     * and it ends. The number of sub-arrays depends on this two index (Start and ends).
     * <p>
     * As element withing this range will be satisfy the condition, we can simply count by how many sub-arrays would be there
     * which is (end-start) = x => x + (x-1) + (x-2) .... 1 [ formula ]
     * As from start to end, increasing start also give you another sub-array which follow condition.
     * <p>
     * But there is a catch.
     * <p>
     * if any element within sub-array is < low then there is two things happen
     * 1. The whole sub-array will definitely make a required sub-array following condition regardless the element index < l
     * 2. but sub-array at this index (element  < l) would not make any sub-array as this won't follow this condition. Hence we need
     * to discard those sub-arrays, in which the elements are < l.
     * <p>
     * So, how do we find those sub-arrays which need to consider and discard.
     * Let say we have a sub-array start at "start" index and ends at "end" index
     * <p>
     * Let say: indexes which are < l are [p..q]
     * <p>
     * If "start<p && end>q" then we can consider these sub-arrays (by using formula).
     * and those sub-array [p,..q] we can discard and reduce them from above.
     * <p>
     * Otherwise element > r then we need to discard whole sub-array and start a new sub-array.
     * <p>
     * Note: to simplify the case of [p..q] we can keep a indexer which tells where it see a element which was not in the range [l,r], then we simply discard all before current index
     *
     * @param a
     * @param l
     * @param r
     * @return
