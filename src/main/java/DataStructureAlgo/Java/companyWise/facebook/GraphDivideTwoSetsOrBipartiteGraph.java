 * Motivation to the solution:
 * <p>
 * Given an undirected graph and a number m, determine if the graph can be colored with at most m colors such
 * that no two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with the same color. Here coloring of a graph means the assignment of colors to all vertices.
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * 1) A 2D array graph[V][V] where V is the number of vertices in graph and graph[V][V] is adjacency matrix representation of the graph.
 * A value graph[i][j] is 1 if there is a direct edge from i to j, otherwise graph[i][j] is 0.
 * 2) An integer m which is the maximum number of colors that can be used.
 * <p>
 * Output:
 * An array color[V] that should have numbers from 1 to m. color[i] should represent the color assigned to the ith vertex.
 * The code should also return false if the graph cannot be colored with m colors.
