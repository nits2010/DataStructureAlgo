 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/
 * <p>
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/move-zeroes-end-array/
 * Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
 * Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
 * Minimize the total number of operations.

/**
 * The total number of operations of the previous approach is sub-optimal. For example,
 * the array which has all (except last) leading zeroes: [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1].How many write operations to the array?
 * For the previous approach, it writes 0's n−1 times, which is not necessary.
 * We could have instead written just once. How? .....
 * <p>
 * By only fixing the non-0 element,i.e., 1.
 * <p>
 * The optimal approach is again a subtle extension of above solution. A simple realization is if the current element is non-0,
 * its' correct position can at best be it's current position or a position earlier. If it's the latter one,
 * the current position will be eventually occupied by a non-0 ,or a 0, which lies at a index greater than 'cur' index.
 * We fill the current position by 0 right away,so that unlike the previous solution, we don't need to come back here in next iteration.
 * <p>
 * In other words, the code will maintain the following invariant:
 * <p>
 * All elements before the slow pointer (lastNonZeroFoundAt) are non-zeroes.
 * All elements between the current and slow pointer are zeroes.
 * <p>
 * Therefore, when we encounter a non-zero element, we need to swap elements pointed by current and slow pointer,
 * then advance both pointers. If it's zero element, we just advance current pointer.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * However, the total number of operations are optimal. The total operations (array writes) that code does is Number of non-0 elements.
 * This gives us a much better best-case (when most of the elements are 0) complexity than last solution.
 * However, the worst-case (when all elements are non-0) complexity for both the algorithms is same.
