 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/similar-rgb-color/
 * <p>
 * In the following, every capital letter represents some hexadecimal digit from 0 to f.
 * The red-green-blue color "#AABBCC" can be written as "#ABC" in shorthand.  For example, "#15c" is shorthand for the color "#1155cc".
 * Now, say the similarity between two colors "#ABCDEF" and "#UVWXYZ" is -(AB - UV)^2 - (CD - WX)^2 - (EF - YZ)^2.
 * Given the color "#ABCDEF", return a 7 character color that is most similar to #ABCDEF, and has a shorthand (that is, it can be represented as some "#XYZ"
 * Example 1:
 * Input: color = "#09f166"
 * Output: "#11ee66"
 * Explanation:
 * The similarity is -(0x09 - 0x11)^2 -(0xf1 - 0xee)^2 - (0x66 - 0x66)^2 = -64 -9 -0 = -73.
 * This is the highest among any shorthand color.
 * Note:
 * color is a string of length 7.
 * color is a valid RGB color: for i > 0, color[i] is a hexadecimal digit from 0 to f
 * Any answer which has the same (highest) similarity as the best answer will be accepted.
 * All inputs and outputs should use lowercase letters, and the output is 7 characters.

     * Observations: The very important points given in question are
     * 1. It should be at most 7 character long (including #, so its 6 char long)
     * 2. It should have shorthand ( means in every pair, the char are duplicate since for aa -> a is shorthand )
     * 3. Color[i] is hexadecimal digit from 0 to f only [ we have in total; 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,b,c,d,e,f] total 16.
     * <p>
     * BruteForce:
     * We can generate all the pair (in total 3) whose char a duplicate within the pair. Once we generate #RGB then take the difference from original color
     * find the minimum one.
     * Since we need to generate a pair (of duplicate) then we left only 16 choices (from 0 to f) and combine them
     * each pair has 16 choices so there will be 3^16 choices.
     * <p>
     * O(type^16) where type says how many color type we can have (here we have type=3)
     * <p>
     * Optimization:
     * In brute force, we did not take the advantage of 1 and 2nd point.
     * if we combine then we are left with follow possible pairs only;
     * [00,11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99,aa,bb,cc,dd,ee,ff] total 16.
     * since R!=G!=B means For R there is 16 choice, B there is 16-1=15 choice and B = 15-1 = 14 choice.
     * <p>
     * Take each of them find the minimum distance between them and given color,choose the minimum one
