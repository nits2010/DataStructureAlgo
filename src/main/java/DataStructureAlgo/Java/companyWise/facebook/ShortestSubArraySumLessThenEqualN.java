    /**
     * Observation:
     * We need to find the smallest sub-array whose sum is >= sum.
     * <p>
     * Lets assume we keep adding the element form left to right and as soon as we find the current sum >= sum that means
     * we found the potential window which start from left and end at current index. [ compute the length ]
     * <p>
     * Now since we need to shirk the window as much as possible ,for that we'll start removing element from left and keep shirking but
     * doing that so, we may miss some sub-array within this window whose sum >= sum [ because array may contains negative numbers ].
     * This means we need to efficiently find from which side we should shirk the array
     * either from left side (removing front element) or right side (removing back element) and in order to find, we need to
     * try both of them, and find the minLength.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * After closely looking into above pattern we find its like sliding window question where we need to find the maximum/minimum
     * element within the window. But since here window is dynamic that can shirk form either side (left/right).
     * <p>
     * The best data structure which provides this feature is Dequeue.
     * Now once we found the suitable data structure for our solution, we need to yet formalize the solution.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * As at any moment we need to shirk the window from left (by removing all the left element sum from current sum ) or shirk from right (by removing all the right element sum from current sum )
     * <p>
     * To find the sum efficiently, we can pre-compute the prefix sum.
     * <p>
     * Let p[i] is the prefix sum of the array from 0 to i-1 element.
     * <p>
     * Now, at any moment our left pointer on x index and right pointer on y index; we are essentially looking for p[y] - p[x] >= sum; for all those x,y we need to find minimum of (y-x)
     * <p>
     * Since p[i] would make sure that elements are in increasing order in p. But there is a catch.
     * What about when array has negative elements in between, in this situation the prefix array might decrease and increase again which is the behaviour of monotonic array.
     * <p>
     * At any moment it happened that current prefix sum is smaller than previous prefix sum, then we won't able to extend this, so we need to shirk that element from left.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Now above expression lets take an example and understand;
     * [2,1,3,4,-3,7] and sum = 7;
     * prefix array would look like [0, 2, 3, 6, 10, 7, 14]
     * <p>
     * Now this is our array which need to consider;
     * *  0  1  2  3  4  5  6
     * * [0, 2, 3, 6, 10, 7, 14]
     * <p>
     * our queue = [] will contains indexes
     * let i = 0; i<prefix.length
     * <p>
     * at i = 0; our queue is empty, we'll push an element to start queue [0]
     * at i = 1; prefix[1] = 2 and   prefix[1] - prefix[queue[front]] < 7 and prefix[1] > prefix[queue[last]] i.e. they are in increasing order; Push this in queue-> [0,1]
     * at i = 2; prefix[2] = 3 and   prefix[2] - prefix[queue[front]] < 7 and prefix[1] > prefix[queue[last]] i.e. they are in increasing order; Push this in queue-> [0,1,2]
     * at i = 3; prefix[3] = 6 and   prefix[3] - prefix[queue[front]] < 7 and prefix[1] > prefix[queue[last]] i.e. they are in increasing order; Push this in queue-> [0,1,2,3]
     * at i = 4; prefix[4] = 10 and  prefix[4] - prefix[queue[front]]  = 10-0 > 7 which means our potential window is found (length=4-0=4) shirk the window till we can't make it, update queue-> [1,2,3]
     * at i = 4; prefix[4] = 10 and  prefix[4] - prefix[queue[front]]  = 10-2 > 7 which means our potential window is found (length=4-1=3) shirk the window, update queue-> [2,3]
     * at i = 4; prefix[4] = 10 and  prefix[4] - prefix[queue[front]]  = 10-3 >= 7 which means our potential window is found (length=4-2=2) shirk the window, update queue-> [3]
     * at i = 4; prefix[4] = 10 and  prefix[4] - prefix[queue[front]]  = 10-6 < 7 which means we can't shirk more and prefix[4] > prefix[queue[last]]  update queue-> [3,4]
     * at i = 5; prefix[5] = 7 and   prefix[5] - prefix[queue[front]]  < 7 but this value got decrease since prefix[5] < prefix[queue[last]]  ; so shirk form right update queue-> [3,5] -> notice the current value in original array is negative
     * at i = 6; prefix[6] = 14 and  prefix[6] - prefix[queue[front]] = 14-6  > 7 which means our potential window is found (length=6-3=3) shirk the window, update queue-> [5]
     * at i = 6; prefix[6] = 14 and  prefix[6] - prefix[queue[front]] = 14-7  >= 7 which means our potential window is found (length=6-5=1*) shirk the window, update queue-> []
