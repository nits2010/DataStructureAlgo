 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-all-odd-and-even-bits/
 * Given an unsigned integer, swap all odd bits with even bits. For example, if the given number is 23 (00010111),
 * it should be converted to 43 (00101011). Every even position bit is swapped with adjacent bit on right side (even position
 * bits are highlighted in binary representation of 23), and every odd position bit is swapped with adjacent on left side..
