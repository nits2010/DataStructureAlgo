 * Maximize the sum of selected numbers from an array to make it empty
 * Given an array of N numbers, we need to maximize the sum of selected numbers. At each step, you need to select a number Ai, delete one occurrence of it and delete all occurrences of Ai-1 and Ai+1 (if they exist) in the array. Repeat these steps until the array gets empty. The problem is to maximize the sum of the selected numbers.
 * <p>
 * Note: We have to delete all the occurrences of Ai+1 and Ai-1 elements if they are present in the array and not Ai+1 and Ai-1.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * Input : a[] = {1, 2, 3}
 * Output : 4
 * Explanation: At first step we select 1, so 1 and
 * 2 are deleted from the sequence leaving us with 3.
 * Then we select 3 from the sequence and delete it.
 * So the sum of selected numbers is 1+3 = 4.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input : a[] =  {1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4}
 * Output : 10
 * Explanation : Select one of the 2's from the array, so
 * 2, 2-1, 2+1 will be deleted and we are left with {2, 2, 4},
 * since 1 and 3 are deleted. Select 2 in next two steps,
 * and then select 4 in the last step.
 * We get a sum of 2+2+2+4=10 which is the maximum possible.
 * <p>
 * //===================================Example walk through ======================
 * {3,3,3,4}
 * If you apply based on value, then you'll end up having result as 4 only, since all 3 will be deleted
 * and if you apply based on occurrence then you'll get 9 as all 4 will be deleted
 * <p>
 * ----------
 * {1,1,1,1,2,3,4}
 * 1 has highest occurrence so lets choose 1
 * case 1: if you choose 1: -> 8 as output
 * 1[1,1,1,3,4]
 * 2[1,1,3,4]
 * 3[1,3,4]
 * 4[3,4] ; You stuck here now, you'll choose highest value so it will be 8 as output.
 * <p>
 * -----------
 * {1,2,2,2,3,3,4}
 * <p>
 * case ; choose 1
 * 1[3,3,4] -> 4 [3] -> 7
 * <p>
 * case : choose 2
 * 2[2,2,4] -> 10
 * <p>
 * case : choose 3
 * 3[1,3] => 7
 * <p>
 * case : choose 4
 * 4[1,2,2,2] -> 10
 * <p>
 * See both choosing highest value and highest occurrence gives answer but we have seen above highest value won't be the choice.
 * <p>
 * i.e. you always select the highest occurrence and when there is tie, you'll chose max value.
 * <p>
 * ------------
 * {1, 2, 2, 2, 3}
 * case 1: if you chose 1 : answer would be 4
 * 1 [3] : all a+1 => 1+1 = 2 will be deleted
 * 4
 * <p>
 * case 2: if you choose 3: answer would be 6
 * 2[2,2]
 * 6
 * <p>
 * case 3: if you choose 3 then ; answer would be 4
 * 3[1]
 * 4
 * <p>
 * So for input {1, 2, 2, 2, 3} output is 6
 * <p>
 * ------------
 * {1,2,2,2,3,3,4}
 * <p>
 * case ; choose 1
 * 1[3,3,4] -> 4 [3] -> 7
 * <p>
 * case : choose 2
 * 2[2,2,4] -> 10
 * <p>
 * case : choose 3
 * 3[1,3] => 7
 * <p>
 * case : choose 4
 * 4[1,2,2,2] -> 10
 * <p>
 * -------------
 * [3,3,3,4]
 * consider you choose 3 then
 * 3 [3,3] ; 4 will be deleted
 * 6[3] ; nothing deleted
 * 9[0] -> 9
 * <p>
 * while if you choose 4
 * 4[] ; all the element get deleted A-1 here 4-1= 3 ..so all 3 will be deleted.
 * -> 4
 * <p>
 * so you'll chose 3 only.
 * output 9
 * ------------
 * 1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2, 3
 * choose all 2 -> 10
