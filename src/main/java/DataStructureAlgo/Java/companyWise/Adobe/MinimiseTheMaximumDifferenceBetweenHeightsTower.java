 * Question: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/minimise-the-maximum-difference-between-the-heights/
 * <p>
 * Given an array of integers A representing heights of towers and a positive integer B.
 * It is allowed to either increase or decrease the height of every tower by B (only once).
 * <p>
 * Find and return the ***"minimum possible difference"*** between the heights of the longest
 * and the shortest tower after modifications.
 * <p>
 * Note: It is mandatory to either increase or decrease the height of every tower.

         * As question says two important things
         * 1, We need to update the value of each element; either increase it or decrease it
         * 2. We need to MINIMIZE THE DIFFERENCE between longest and shortest.
         * <p>
         * As we need to minimize the difference of (longest - shortest) then, it is necessary that
         * 1. longest should be as small as possible but > shortest
         * 2. Shortest should be as greater as possible but < longest
         * <p>
         * By saying this, we need to either
         * 1. increase an element if and only if increasing it makes the difference become less
         * 2. Decreasing an element if and only if decreasing it makes the difference become less
         * <p>
         * for input: {2, 1, 4, 3, 5} and b = 2
         * we can change this array to {(2+2),(1+2),(4-2),(3-2),(5-2)} ={4,3,2,1,3}
         * Min = 1, Max = 4; difference is 3
         * If you apply any other combination too, you;ll either increase the difference or you'll get only at min = 3 difference

         * or decreasing any element affecting min so far.
         * <p>
         * The one way would be try all which is O(n^2)
         * But if we sort the array then we can easily find the smallest and greatest in the window any time.
         * <p>
         * So
         * Step 1: sort the array and find the best difference max{h[n-1]} - min{h[0]}
         * Step 2: now, update both with increase and decrease; min -> increase and max -> decrease because we need to minimize the difference
         * step 3: Iterate all elements test both possibilities

         * then we can do any of them
