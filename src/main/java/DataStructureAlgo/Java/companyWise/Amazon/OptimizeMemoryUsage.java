 * Description:https://aonecode.com/amazon-online-assessment-oa2-optimize-memory-usage
 * <p>
 * Give a computer with total K memory space, and an array of foreground tasks and background tasks the computer need to do.
 * Write an algorithm to find a pair of tasks from each array to maximize the memory usage. Notice the tasks could be done
 * without original order.
 * <p>
 * Input
 * The input to the function/method consists of three arguments :
 * foregroundTask, an array representing the memory usage of the foreground tasks,
 * backgroundTask, an array representing the memory usage of the background tasks,
 * K, the total memory space of the computer.
 * <p>
 * Output
 * Return a list of pairs of the task ids.
 * <p>
 * Examples 1
 * Input:
 * foregroundTasks = [1, 7, 2, 4, 5, 6]
 * backgroundTasks = [3, 1, 2]
 * K = 6
 * <p>
 * Output:
 * [(3, 2), (4, 1)]
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * Here we have 5 foreground tasks: task 0 uses 1 memory. task 1 uses 7 memeory. task 2 uses 2 memeory..
 * And 5 background tasks: task 0 uses 3 memory. task 1 uses 1 memory. task 2 uses 2 memory..
 * We need to find two tasks with total memory usage sum <= K.
 * So we find the foreground task 3 and background task 2. Total memory usage is 6.
 * And the foreground task 4 and background task 1. Total memory usage is also 6.
 * <p>
 * Examples 2
 * Input:
 * foregroundTasks = [1, 7, 2, 4, 5, 6]
 * backgroundTasks = [3, 1, 2]
 * K = 10
 * <p>
 * Output:
 * [(1, 0))]
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * Here we find the foreground task 1 and background task 2. Total memory usage is 7 + 2 = 9, which is < 10.

 * Similar question: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/318918/Amazon-or-Online-Assessment-2019-or-Optimal-Aircraft-Utilization
 * <p>
 * Your task is to write an algorithm to optimize the sets of forward/return shipping route pairs that allow the aircraft to be optimally utilized, given a list a of forward routes and a list of return shipping routes.
 * <p>
 * INPUT
 * The input to the function/method consisits of three arguments:
 * maxTravelDist, an integer representing the maximum operating travel distance of the given aircraft;
 * forwardRouteList, a list of pairs of integers where the first integer represents the unique identifier of a forward shipping
 * route and the second integer represents the amount of travel distance required bu this shipping route;
 * returnRouteList, a list of pairs of integers where the first integer represents the unique identifer of a return shipping route
 * and the second integer represents the amount of travel distance required by this shipping route.
 * <p>
 * OUTPUT
 * Return a list of pairs of integers representing the pairs of IDs of forward and return shipping routes that optimally utilize the given aircraft. If no route is possible, return a list with empty pair.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * maxTravelDist = 7000
 * forwardRouteList = [[1,2000],[2,4000],[3,6000]]
 * returnRouteList = [[1,2000]]
 * <p>
 * Output:
 * [[2,1]]
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * There are only three combinations [1,1],[2,1],and [3,1], which have a total of 4000, 6000, and 8000 miles, respectively. Since 6000 is the largest use that does tnot exceed 7000, [2,1] is the optimal pair.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * maxTravelDist = 10,000
 * forwardRouteList = [[1,3000],[2,5000],[3,7000],[4,10000]]
 * returnRouteList = [[1,2000],[2,3000],[3,4000],[4,5000]]
 * <p>
 * Output:
 * [[2,4],[3,2]]
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * There are two pairs of forward and return shipping routes possible that optimally utilizes the given aircraft.
 * Shipping Route ID#2 from the forwardShippingRouteList, required 5000 miles travelled,
 * and Shipping Route ID#4 from returnShippingRouteList also required 5000 miles travelled. Combined, they add up to 10000 miles travelled.
 * Similarly, Shipping Route ID#3 from forwardShippingRouteList requires 7000 miles travelled, and
 * Shipping Route ID#2 from returnShippingRouteList requires 3000 miles travelled. These also add up to 10000 miles travelled. Therefore,
 * the pairs of forward and return shipping routes that optimally utilize the aircraft are [2,4] and [3,2].
