 * Hanna moves in a lattice where every point can be represented by a pair of integers.
 * She moves from point A to point B and then takes a turn 90 degrees right and starts moving till she reaches
 * the first point on the lattice. Find what's the point she would reach?

     * Let (dx,dy) = (Bx,By)-(Ax,Ay), the vector from point A to point B.
     * <p>
     * We can rotate this by 90 degrees to give (dy,-dx).
