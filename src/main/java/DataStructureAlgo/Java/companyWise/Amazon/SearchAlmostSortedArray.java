 * Description: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-almost-sorted-array/#_=_
 * Given an array which is sorted, but after sorting some elements are moved to either of the adjacent positions, i.e.,
 * arr[i] may be present at arr[i+1] or arr[i-1]. Write an efficient function to search an element in this array.
 * Basically the element arr[i] can only be swapped with either arr[i+1] or arr[i-1].
 * <p>
 * For example consider the array {2, 3, 10, 4, 40}, 4 is moved to next position and 10 is moved to previous position.
 * <p>
 * Example :
 * <p>
 * Input: arr[] =  {10, 3, 40, 20, 50, 80, 70}, key = 40
 * Output: 2
 * Output is index of 40 in given array
 * <p>
 * Input: arr[] =  {10, 3, 40, 20, 50, 80, 70}, key = 90
 * Output: -1
 * -1 is returned to indicate element is not present
