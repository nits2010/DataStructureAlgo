 * Author: Nitin Gupta
 * Date: 21/09/19
 * Description:https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/353827/Google-or-Onsite-or-Shortest-Path-Breaking-Through-Walls/
 * Given a 2D grid of size r * c. 0 is walkable, and 1 is a wall. You can move up, down, left or right at a time.
 * Now you are allowed to break at most 1 wall, what is the minimum steps to walk from the upper left corner (0, 0) to the lower right corner (r-1, c-1)?
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 * [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 * [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
 * [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]]
 * <p>
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Change `1` at (0, 1) to `0`, the shortest path is as follows:
 * (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 4) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (3, 4)
 * There are other options of length 7, not listed here.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * [[0, 1, 1],
 * [1, 1, 0],
 * [1, 1, 0]]
 * <p>
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: Regardless of which `1` is changed to `0`, there is no viable path.
 * Follow-up:
 * What if you can break k walls?
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: k = 2
 * [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 * [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 * [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 * [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 * [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]]
 * <p>
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: Change (2, 4) and (3, 4) to `0`.
 * Route (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 4) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4)
 * <p>
 * Other way of asking
 * Given a m x n matrix represents a maze, X is the starting point, Y is the destination, . is walkable, and # is a wall.
 * You can walk in four directions: up, down, left and right. Now you are allowed to break at most K walls, what is the minimum steps to walk from X to Y ?
 * For example, we have the following maze, and you can break at most 3 walls:
 * . X . # . .
 * . # . . # .
 * . # . . . .
 * . # # . . .
 * . Y . . . .
 * . . . . . #
 * As you can see, the minimum steps to walk from X to Y is 4, that is we just have to break those 3 walls under X and then go straight to Y .

/**
 * Brute force:
 * We can apply backtracking approach {DFS} and try all the paths and try all possibilities of breaking walls till you can break
 * just like {@link DataStructureAlgo.Java.companyWise.thoughtspot.ShortestPathRoadFlightAtMostNFlight} backtracking approach
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The most interesting part of this question is 'breaking the wall'. In case, this option wasn't there then we can simply apply BFS Algorithm
 * just like {@link DataStructureAlgo.Java.companyWise.Amazon.RemoveObstacleRobotMinimumDistance} or many other problem like this.
 * But since we are allowed to break at most 'k' walls, then we need to see through those options too.
 * Which imply that, keeping only distance by going through a path is not enough, we also need to keep a indicator which tells that how many walls we have break in order to reach till this point.
 * Since we are allowed to break at most 'k' walls then this indicator also help us to know do we allowed to break any more walls or not from this point onwards or not.
 * <p>
 * path[i][j] denotes the minimum distance to reach point (i,j) from source
 * extend this to include walls
 * path[i][j][w] denotes the minimum distance to reach point (i,j) by breaking 'w' walls
