 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ways-transforming-one-string-removing-0-characters/
 *
 * Given two sequences A, B, find out number of unique ways in sequence A, to form a subsequence of A that is identical to the
 * sequence B. Transformation is meant by converting string A (by removing 0 or more characters) to string B.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input : A = "abcccdf", B = "abccdf"
 * Output : 3
 * Explanation : Three ways will be -> "ab.ccdf",
 * "abc.cdf" & "abcc.df" .
 * "." is where character is removed.
 *
 * Input : A = "aabba", B = "ab"
 * Output : 4
 * Expalnation : Four ways will be -> "a.b..",
 *  "a..b.", ".ab.." & ".a.b." .
 * "." is where characters are removed.
 * Asked in : [Google]
