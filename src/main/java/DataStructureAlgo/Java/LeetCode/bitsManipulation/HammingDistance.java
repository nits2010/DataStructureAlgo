     * <p>
     * The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
     * <p>
     * Now your job is to find the total Hamming distance between all pairs of the given numbers.
     * <p>
     * Example:
     * Input: 4, 14, 2
     * <p>
     * Output: 6
     * <p>
     * Explanation: In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is 0010 (just
     * showing the four bits relevant in this case). So the answer will be:
     * HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) + HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
     * Note:
     * Elements of the given array are in the range of 0 to 10^9
     * Length of the array will not exceed 10^4.
     * Count each bit in 32 bit
     * O(n)
     *

     * @return
