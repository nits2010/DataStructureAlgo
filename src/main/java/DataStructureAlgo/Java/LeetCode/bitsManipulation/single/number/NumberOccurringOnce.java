 * Description: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-element-that-appears-once/
 * <p>
 * Given an array where every element occurs three times, except one element which occurs only once.
 * Find the element that occurs once. Expected time complexity is O(n) and O(1) extra space.
 * Examples :
 * <p>
 * Input: arr[] = {12, 1, 12, 3, 12, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3}
 * Output: 2
 * In the given array all element appear three times except 2 which appears once.
 * <p>
 * Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 10, 30, 10, 30, 30}
 * Output: 20
 * In the given array all element appear three times except 20 which appears once.
