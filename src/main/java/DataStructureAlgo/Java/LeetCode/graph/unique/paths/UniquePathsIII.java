 * 980. Unique Paths III
 * On a 2-dimensional grid, there are 4 types of squares:
 * 1 represents the starting square.  There is exactly one starting square.
 * 2 represents the ending square.  There is exactly one ending square.
 * 0 represents empty squares we can walk over.
 * -1 represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.
 * Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: We have the following two paths:
 * 1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
 * 2. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: We have the following four paths:
 * 1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)
 * 2. (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
 * 3. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
 * 4. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)
 * Example 3:
 * Input: [[0,1],[2,0]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation:
 * There is no path that walks over every empty square exactly once.
 * Note that the starting and ending square can be anywhere in the grid.
 * Note:
 * 1 <= grid.length * grid[0].length <= 20
 * <p>
 * Similar to {@link UniquePaths}

/**
 * Idea is similar to {@link UniquePaths}.
 * Here an important constraint is 'walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.'
 * which means we need to touch every gate (0) exactly once, Which means we also need to count the number of gates in our grid.
 * <p>
 * So whenever we reach number of gate + 2 {because 1 is for source and 1 is for destination} then we found our path provided that we reach destination.
 * <p>
 * We can count all values in grid where its not obstacle !=-1 as gates 'non-obstacle'
 * <p>
 * Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 78.70% of Java online submissions for Unique Paths III.
 * Memory Usage: 34 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Unique Paths III.
 * <p>
 * Complexity: n = R*C
 * Time complexity: From each cell, we visit 4 direction cells. Hence ~T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + T(n-3) + T(n-4) + O(1). = ~O(4 ^ n)
 * Space : 4 direction walk, at most 4 stack frames for each cell. Hence O(4*n) = O(n)

 * code(r, c) returns a binary bit string with a length of the total number of cells. Each bit represents a cell of the grid.
 * If the bit the 1, the cell is to be visited. Here bitwise or is used to get a binary bit string where all the cells to be visited are masked 1, while others are masked 0.
 * <p>
 * every time you visit a cell, you divide all the cells in the grid into two groups: cells you have visited in this particular path until now

 * you are visiting this cell as the 5th cell in a particular path. how many possible ways can you represent those cells you still need to visit. the answer
 * depends on which 4 cells you have visited so far. that could be any 4 of the n elements, so what is left is n-4 out of n elements..how many of those are there?
 * if you think about it, the answer is how many ways are there to create subsets of size n-4....
 * <p>
 * this is if this cell is the fifth in a path, what about if it is the 4th or the 7th...then you need to find all the subsets with size n-3 or n-6..if you follow this logic,
