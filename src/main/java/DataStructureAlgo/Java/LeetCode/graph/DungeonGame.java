 * Description:https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/
 * 174. Dungeon Game[Hard]
 * The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.
 * <p>
 * The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
 * <p>
 * Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).
 * <p>
 * In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.
 * <p>
 * For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.
 * Input:
 * *      -2 (K)	    -3	    3
 * *      -5	        -10	    1
 * *       10	    30	    -5 (P)
 * <p>
 * Output: 7
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * *[[-8,-6,3],[2,8,-10],[-8,-12,-6]] Output: 15
 * Note:
 * The knight's health has no upper bound.
 * Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

/**
 * * In order to find the minimum health that kind knight should have, is all depends how he is able to reach at the Princes.
 * * In case we need to find a number that make sure knight should have as health, then we can assign any big number
 * * that is enough to reach from (0,0) to (m-1,n-1)
 * * Since we need to find 'minimum' health to be, we need to traverse back from princes (m-1,n-1)  to (0,0)
 * * and see, what is the minimum value expected to be.
 * * Example:
 * * * *      -2 (K)	    -3	    3
 * * * *      -5	        -10	    1
 * * * *       10	        30	   -5 (P)
 * * <p>
 * * -5 -> 1 -> 3 -> -3 -> -2 = -6 means with health 6, knight will reach prices but he'll get die as health become zero. Hence answer is 7
 * * * [-8,-6,3]
 * * * [2,8,-10]
 * * * [-8,-12,-6]
 * * -6 -> -10 -> 8 -> 2 -> -8 = -14 => 15 is our answer
 * * <p>
 * * Apply same logic as {@link MinimumPathSum}. from bottom to top.
 * <p>
 * *
 * * minHealth(i, j)  = Min ( minHealth(i+1,j), minHealth(i,j+1) )  - grid[i][j]
 * * return minHealth[i][j] <= 0 ? 1 : minHealth[i][j]
 * Base case: When there is only one cell, and you are at princes.
 * Then if grid[m-1][n-1] > 0 Means you don't need extra health, as no one is proteting princies Hence '1'
 * otherwise -grid[m-1][n-1] +1 because at least that much blood will be taken by that guard.
 * <p>
 * * Complexity: O(m*n) / O(m*n)
 * <p>
 * Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Dungeon Game.
 * Memory Usage: 36.2 MB, less than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Dungeon Game.
