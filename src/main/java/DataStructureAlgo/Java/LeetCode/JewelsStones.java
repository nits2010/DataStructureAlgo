/**
 * Author: Nitin Gupta
 * Date: 2019-08-16
 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/
 * <p>
 * You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
 * <p>
 * The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
 * Output: 3
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
 * Output: 0
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
 * The characters in J are distinct.
