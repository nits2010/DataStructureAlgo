 * Description:
 * Given stocks value for each day, find the longest duration at which you can hold the stocks such that you don't incur any loss.
 * Provided that
 * 1> Buy the stock exactly once
 * 2> Sell the stock exactly once
 * 3> Can buy and sell on the same day
 * <p>
 * Input: [3,2,1,4]
 * output: 3 { you can have the stock at 0th index v=3 and hold till 3rd index v=4}
 * <p>
 * input [8,5,8,3,9,1,6]
 * output: 5 { you can have the stock at 1th index v=5 and hold till 6th index v=6}

/**
 * Important point from above algo;
 * 'To maximize (j-i) we need to make sure that i should be as much as left and j should be as much as on right.
 * a[j]>a[i]'
 * <p>
 * which means if we can find a way faster than O(n) to tell what is the a[i] and a[j] at any index s.t. a[j] > a[i].
 * Then we can calculate the maxDiff faster.
 * <p>
 * How to find a[i] and a[j] ?
 * Important thing here is a[i] < a[j] for each j (j>i). Means we need to see at any index what is the smaller before it [i]
 * Similarly we need to see at each index what is the greater after it. [j].
 * Since we need to maximize [j-i], then we need to find rightmost element which is greater after it and leftmost element with is smaller to it
 * <p>
 * To find, we can build Prefix and suffix array.
 * Prefix Array (smaller on left) : go from left to right and find min
 * Suffix array (greater on right): go from right to left and find max
 * <p>
 * After building those two array, we can
 * test
 * if(prefix[i] < suffix[j]) then calculate max diff
 * since we need to maximize j-i, then we shift j here
 * otherwise i
