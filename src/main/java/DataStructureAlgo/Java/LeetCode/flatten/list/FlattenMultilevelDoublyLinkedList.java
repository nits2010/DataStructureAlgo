/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/
 * You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers,
 * it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list.
 * These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure,
 * as shown in the example below.
 * <p>
 * Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first
 * level of the list.
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * *  1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
 * *          |
 * *          7---8---9---10--NULL
 * *              |
 * *              11--12--NULL
 * *
 * Output:
 * 1-2-3-7-8-11-12-9-10-4-5-6-NULL
 * <p>
 * {@link FlattenMultilevelSinglyListDepthWise}
 * <p>
 * To flatten in depth wise, we need to dfs at each child and once child are exhausted, we apply same for next
 * The important point is, after dfs completed on a node, we need to connect its next node with the deepest dfs node
 * * * 1 - 2 - 3 - 4
 * * *     |
 * * *     7 -  8 - 10 - 12
 * * *     |    |    |
 * * *     9    16   11
 * * *     |    |
 * * *     14   17 - 18 - 19 - 20
 * * *     |                    |
 * * *     15 - 23             21
 * * *          |
 * * *          24
 * In above example;
 * 1. dfs on '2'
 * 2. dfs on '7'
 * 3. dfs on '9'......
 * ...
 * n) dfs on 23
 * n+1) dfs on 24 but there is not next and child, then here we end dfs
 * While coming down keep connecting the correct next/prev node using last.
 *
 * <p>
 * Algo:
 * 1. cache next node, and update last node as current node
 * 2. if child, connect last and child; do dfs on child;
 * 3. if no child, connect last and next; go to cached next node;
 * <p>
 * Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List.
 * Memory Usage: 37.4 MB, less than 82.50% of Java online submissions for Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List.
