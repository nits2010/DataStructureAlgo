 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-median/
 * Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * [2,3,4] , the median is 3
 * <p>
 * [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
 * <p>
 * Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Your job is to output the median array for each window in the original array.
 * <p>
 * For example,
 * Given nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3.
 * <p>
 * Window position                Median
 * ---------------               -----
 * [1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       1
 * 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       -1
 * 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       -1
 * 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       3
 * 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       5
 * 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      6
 * Therefore, return the median sliding window as [1,-1,-1,3,5,6].
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * You may assume k is always valid, ie: k is always smaller than input array's size for non-empty array.

     * What is a median in a array?
     * Median is a guy ;
     * 1. either who sits in between of all numbers in sorted array, if total is odd
     * 2. or average of middle two element in sorted array. if total is even
     * <p>
     * This implies that left side of median is all smaller than median and right side of median is all greater then median.
     * To calculate, we only need to know how many are on left side and right side
     * <p>
     * 1. If they are equal (total=odd) then median will lie on high side (due to 0 indexing)
     * 2. otherwise it will be average of left side max and right side min.
     * <p>
     * Hence we need to know at any moment what is max at left side and what is min or right side.
     * <p>
     * Data structure:
     * The best data structure which provide this is Heaps. Heap can give max and min in O(1) time at any moment.
     * <p>
     * Lets make
     * maxHeap on left side of Median
     * MinHeap on right side of Median
     * <p>
     * Case 1: equal size;
     * As stated above when size of both the heap are equal, then essentially there is even number of elements : take average of roots of heaps
     * <p>
     * case 2: Un-equal size
     * Since we follow 0 indexing then there is always 1 more element on left side, so median is maxHeap root
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Important:
     * At any moment we need to maintain the size of heap such that they don't differ more than 1 element.
     * if so, then make sure maxHeap has 1 element more than min heap Otherwise they should be equal
