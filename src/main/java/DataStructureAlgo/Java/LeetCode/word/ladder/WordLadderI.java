 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/
 * 127. Word Ladder [Medium]
 * Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:
 * <p>
 * Only one letter can be changed at a time.
 * Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
 * All words have the same length.
 * All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
 * You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
 * You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * beginWord = "hit",
 * endWord = "cog",
 * wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
 * <p>
 * Output: 5
 * <p>
 * Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
 * return its length 5.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * beginWord = "hit"
 * endWord = "cog"
 * wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
 * <p>
 * Output: 0
 * <p>
 * Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

/*
Since we need to transform the 'begin' word to 'end' word with constraint to change only 1 letter at a time, that means the word list either contain the 'begin' word
or word list should contain words that is 1 distance away from 'begin' word.
Now, once we find the word to start, we need to traverse all the word that is 1 distance away and present in the word list.

It boils down to a undirected graph with weight 1. Here weight shows the number of character need to change from a word to a word. In our case its 1. {we can generalize it }.

Now, to efficiently find all the nodes which is 1 weight away from a node, we should pre-process the given word list and find all the nodes that are 1 distance away and hence form the unweighted
graph.

Now, we just need to start form the 'begin' node and see all the nodes in the graph which is 1 distance away and keep moving in that path. Since we need 'shortest transformation sequence'
we can use BFS to achieve it.

Algorithm:
1. Convert given list to undirected graph which are 1 distance away only.
2. Start from 'begin' node and explore all the path that are 1 distance away
3. as soon as you hit end word, return the distance travelled.

N - Length of list of word
M - maximum length of a word

/**
 * Instead of running single BFS as in {@link WordLadderIBFS} we can do bi-directional bfs.
 * One bfs from source to destination node
 * one bfs from destination to source node
 * at the same time.
 * <p>
 * When we reach a state, where both of the current node are same, we are done with the process.
 * <p>
 * Bidirectional Search uses 2 simultaneous BFS searches to find the distance between 2 nodes (by alternating between the searches)
 * <p>
 * Bidirectional Search
 * <p>
 * For BFS, if d is the distance between the 2 nodes, and b is the branching factor, 1 way to represent the runtime is O(bd).
 * <p>
 * For Bidirectional search, the runtime is O(b(d/2)) + O(b(d/2)) = O(2*b(d/2)) = O(b(d/2)) since each search only has to search halfway before meeting the other search.
 * <p>
 * Applying Bidirectional Search to our original solution
 * <p>
 * Our original solution used 1 Deque as a queue, and 1 Set to mark visited Strings. Since we are running 2 BFS searches, we will make 2 of these Deques and 2 of these Sets.
 * To simulate 2 BFS searches "simultaneously", we alter between which of the 2 Deques we deque from.
 * We now have 2 Deques to deque from, and 2 "visited" Sets, but we don't want to duplicate code. We will create a general function called checkNeighbors() that takes a Deque and Set as input, to help us alternate between the 2 BFS searches.
 * If at any time a String gets dequed, and one of its neighbors has already been visited from the opposite side's parallel search, we've found a solution.
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For Bidirectional search, the runtime is O(b^(d/2)) + O(b^(d/2)) = O(2*b^(d/2)) = O(b^(d/2)) since each search only has to search halfway before meeting the other search.
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(b^(d/2)) as explained at beginning of Solution 2. In our case, b is the max size of the Set returned by getNeighbors(), making b = O(26m) = O(m) where m is length of longest word.
 * Space Complexity: Same as in Solution 1.
