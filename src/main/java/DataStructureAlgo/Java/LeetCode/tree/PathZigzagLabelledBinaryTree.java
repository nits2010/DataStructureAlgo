 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/path-in-zigzag-labelled-binary-tree/
 * In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are labelled in row order.
 * <p>
 * In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is left to right,
 * while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to left.
 * Given the label of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the root of the tree to the node with that label.
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: label = 14
 * Output: [1,3,4,14]
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: label = 26
 * Output: [1,2,6,10,26]
 * <p>

 * *      4     5   6     7

             * In normal tree, the parent of any node is calculated by v/2.
             * Since the tree is zig-zag; which parents of every node has push to other side but they have symmetry
             *
             * For example: Node=14
             * For normal tree: 14/2 = 7
             * For zig-zag tree: Nodes just above this node are
             * 4 , 5 , 6 , 7
             * So if it were normal tree, the parent is on 7 while if its zig-zag then its on 4. Which is symmetrical.
             *
             * Hence,
             *
             * Find how many nodes are there at this level.
             * This level labeling would start from Math.pow(2, level - 1))
             * and end at (Math.pow(2, level) - 1
             *
             * Which is equivalent to ((1 << level) - 1) + (1 << (level - 1))
