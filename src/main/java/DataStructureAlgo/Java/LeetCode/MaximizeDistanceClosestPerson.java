/**
 * Author: Nitin Gupta
 * Date: 2019-07-07
 * Description:https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-distance-to-closest-person/
 * n a row of seats, 1 represents a person sitting in that seat, and 0 represents that the seat is empty.
 * <p>
 * There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.
 * <p>
 * Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized.
 * <p>
 * Return that maximum distance to closest person.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * If Alex sits in the second open seat (seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
 * If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
 * Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: [1,0,0,0]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * If Alex sits in the last seat, the closest person is 3 seats away.
 * This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.
