 * Author: Nitin Gupta
 * Date: 2019-08-08
 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/non-decreasing-array/
 * Given an array with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.
 * <p>
 * We define an array is non-decreasing if array[i] <= array[i + 1] holds for every i (1 <= i < n).
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: [4,2,3]
 * Output: True
 * Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: [4,2,1]
 * Output: False
 * Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.
 * Note: The n belongs to [1, 10,000].

/**
 * If we observe carefully, we can say that the answer depends how elements are changing the "direction" of increasing and decreasing flow.
 * Lets take an example
 * [ 1 4 6 18 10 12 14 11 ] -> We can see that element change its increasing/decreasing at first the point 10 (since 18 > 10 ) and then again on
 * 11 ( as 14 > 11 )
 * <p>
 * we can simply say that its not possible to change it to any way to make it Increasing order
 * Or
 * [ 12 10 8 14 13 12 11 16 ] -> First point 10  ( as 12 > 10 ) and 8 ( 10 > 8 ) ...and many other
 * <p>
 * Lets understand this with a graph [ 1 4 6 18 10 12 14 11 ]
 * *
 * *
 * *
 * *               14
 * *       18    12   11
 * *      6   10
 * *     4
 * *    1
 * *
 * You see the elements change direction at two different point at 10 and 11,
 * <p>
 * Rule 1: If array has more than one slopping point then its not possible to convert it to increasing order.
 * <p>
 * Now, we need to find when we can convert it to increasing order though ?
 * * [ 1 4 6 18 10 12 14 16 ]
 * *             16
 * *           14
 * *      18  12
 * *     6  10
 * *    4
 * *  1
 * Here only 1 direction change, then we might possibly can change the array to non-decreasing order.
 * <p>
 * How do we decide though ?
 * In order to change a number s.t. its in increasing order is define by the nearest element of the changing point.why?
 * Because if they form an increasing patten then we can take any of them to make array as non-decreasing pattern. Right
 * example
 * [ 1 4 6 18 10 12 14 16 ]  -> [ 1 4 6 10 10 12 14 16 ]  [ here change point is 10, neighbour were 18 and 12 and since  18 > 10 and 10 < 12 i.e. 18 > 12
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * so all its depend on neighbour elements.
 * Good enough.
 * But there is a edge case of element at the corner ( first element or last element ) as they dont have neighbour. In this case change any of them to other neighbour would work
 * [ 20 4 6 10 12 14 16 18 ] -> [ 4 4 6 10 12 14 16 18 ] { first element cause issue}
 * [ 4 6 10 12 14 16 8 ] -> [ 4 6 10 12 14 16 16 ] { last element cause issue}
 * Hence in this case its simply true;
 * <p>
 * Algo:
 * 1. Find is there any slope point
 * 2. if slope point exist change point > 1 ; return false
 * 3. if slope point exist & change point = 1 ; Check neighbour { check does the change point is first or last element }
 * 4. if slope point don't exist (change point=  0 ) then return true
