 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers-sum/
 * 829. Consecutive Numbers Sum
 * Given a positive integer N, how many ways can we write it as a sum of consecutive positive integers?
 * Example 1:
 * Input: 5
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 5 = 5 = 2 + 3
 * Example 2:
 * Input: 9
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 9 = 9 = 4 + 5 = 2 + 3 + 4
 * Example 3:
 * Input: 15
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: 15 = 15 = 8 + 7 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
 * Note: 1 <= N <= 10 ^ 9.
 * <p>
 * Best solution is {@link ConsecutiveSumMath3}
 * One more good solution

/**
 * We can solve this problem mathematically.
 * To express a number in form of sum of 'M consecutive increasing numbers', we can write m as
 * N =  (a+1) + (a+2) + (a+3)....+(a+M)
 * => N = (M*a + (1+2+3+...M)
 * => N = ((M*a + M*(M+1)/2 )
 * => N = M * (a + (M+1)/2)
 * => N = M * ( 2*a + M+1) / 2
 * => 2*N = M * ( 2*a + M+1)
 * => a = (((2*N) / M) - M - 1)/2
 * <p>
 * Since here N, M all are integer, then a has be integer as well to suffice the condition.
 * Here
 * 1<= M <= 2*N
