 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/
 * <p>
 * We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.
 * <p>
 * Each turn, we choose the two heaviest rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:
 * <p>
 * If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
 * If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
 * At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
 * we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
 * we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
 * we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= stones.length <= 30
 * 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000
 * <p>

/**
 * We can apply bucket sort to make it work in linear time.
 * Since
 * 1 <= stones.length <= 30
 * 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Find the maximum value in the stones array.
 * 2. Create that many buckets; bucket[max]
 * 3. Count the frequency of each bucket
 * 4. Run backward from bucket for each element from max to 0
 * <p>
 * a. if this bucket has even frequency; then they will destroy each other; move back
 * b. If this bucket has odd frequency[i]; then we need to find another bucket[j] and then update the bucket whose value is [i-j]+1
 * As well decrease the frequency of this buckets as we used both of the stones.
 * <p>
 * Keep doing this, at the end the bucket which has frequency > 0 and its odd is your value.
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Complexity:
 * Space: O(max) ; since 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000 then O(1000) is constant => O(1)
 * <p>
 * Time: O(n) {bucket frequency} + the maximum value of stones= 1000 and the max length of stones is 30 [1 <= stones.length <= 30[.
 * In wost scenario; all stones are duplicate Or unique or flatten like [1,1,1,1,1000]
 * <p>
 * at max the loop will run 1000 time. Hence constant
 * <p>
 * Space: O(1)
 * Time: O(n+1000) => O(n)
 * <p>
 * * Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 97.26% of Java online submissions for Last Stone Weight.
