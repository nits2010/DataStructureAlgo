 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/
 * Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
 * <p>
 * '.' Matches any single character.
 * '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
 * The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
 * p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like . or *.
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * s = "aa"
 * p = "a"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * s = "aa"
 * p = "a*"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * s = "ab"
 * p = ".*"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
 * Example 4:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * s = "aab"
 * p = "c*a*b"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore, it matches "aab".
 * Example 5:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * s = "mississippi"
 * p = "mis*is*p*."
 * Output: false

    /**
     * Lets first understand how to approach ths and solve this, as this is not regular general question (because of "*" ) we need to try and hit few example to understand what really happen
     * whenever we try to match any two character of pattern and text.
     * <p>
     * Lets take very simple example first;
     * <p>
     * Example 1: text = "" and pattern = "" [ Both are empty or null ].
     * Approach: Its clear that if pattern is null or empty then text has to be either null or empty, then only they match.
     * Hence
     * Deduction 1: if ( p == null || p.isEmpty() ) return (text == null || text.isEmpty() )
     * <p>
     * Now onwards i'll make the example more complex but will do bit by bit so that we can find out the pattern
     * <p>
     * Example  2: text = "a" and pattern ="" [ text is not empty but patter is ]. We hit the above condition and we result to "False"
     * <p>
     * Example 3: text = "a" and pattern = "a" [ both have single character ]
     * Approach: as we can simply see both have single character and they "match" so our result is True
     * Deduction 2: if both character in pattern and text match, then we say they “match Probably” [ I’ll explain probably in  a while ]
     * <p>
     * Example 4: text=”ab” and pattern = “a”
     * Approach: We see at index 0 in both they match, but there still some character left in text ( not ‘.’ And ‘*’ ) so they don’t match.
     * Deduction 3: if there is some character remaining in text after matching complete text then they don’t match= false ; provided that remaining characters are not ‘.’ And ‘*’
     * <p>
     * I think, now you have pretty good idea about character vs character
     * <p>
     * Lets introduce some ‘.’.
     * <p>
     * Example 5: text=”ab” and pattern = “a.” [ patter has 1 ‘.’ At the last ]
     * Approach: As both first character are match we left with text=”b” and pattern=”.” , Since “.” Says it can match to any character, hence we left with text = “” and pattern=”” and we have the solution for this already. Case 1; Hence True
     * <p>
     * Deduction 4: Both character and “.” Behaves in same way, either both are character in pattern and text and they match or pattern is a “.” Also that match provided that previous text and pattern match.
     * <p>
     * Let make it more complex
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Example 5: text=”ab” and pattern = “a..” [ patter has 2 ‘.’ At the last ]
     * Approach: We saw ‘a’ and ‘a’ match, we left with “b” and “..”. Now we hit a dot, then we’ll see does “” and “.” Match, which says No as text is empty and pattern is not. Hence False.
     * Deduction 5: Just same as Deduction 4 with minor tweak.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Lets introduce the killer of this question “*”
     * <p>
     * Example 6: text=”ab” and pattern = “a*” [ patter has 1 ‘*’ At the last ]
     * Approach: We know that “*” means that Either zero or at least 1 character match with “just previous to *”. [ That’s important point ]
     * Which means that we can assume that there is no character before “*” and there is at least 1 character same as previous of “*”.
     * Hence
     * In our example;
     * “ab” -> “a*” =>  “b” -> “*” =>  Don’t match Hence False
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Example 7: text=”ab” and pattern = “ab*” [ patter has 1 ‘*’ At the last ]
     * “ab” -> “ab*” => “b” -> “b*”
     * Now we are at the critical point, what happens here?
     * There is two path possible ,
     * Either we say
     * “b” -> “” [ zero occurrence of b ] => False
     * “b” -> “b” [ 1 occurrence of b ] => True
     * “b” -> “bb” [ We don’t need to move ahead as that enough to test, in this case ]
     * <p>
     * Deduction 6: Whenever we hit star “*” we need to look back 1 or 2 character behind.
     * 2 because we are assuming that there no occurrence of previous character (of “*” ) or 1 because there at least 1 occurrence of previous character (of “*”).
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Deduction: If you observe carefully, each time we have to look back what was the solution if don’t have the current pattern character ( either character or “.” OR ‘*” ].
     * <p>
     * Which tells us to cache the solution Hence DP [ as this tells if you know previous solution you can build this solution and they are overlap too ].
     * <p>
     * Let’s taka a final example to prove our point
     * <p>
     * Example: text = “xaabyc” pattern = “xa*b.c” [ has 1 * and 1 “.” ]
     * Lets match
     * “xaabyc” -> “xa*b.c” => “aabyc” -> “a*b.c”
     * => “abyc” -> “*b.c” OR
     * => “abyc” -> “ab.c”
     * => “byc” -> “b.c” => “yc” -> “.c” => “c” -> “c” => “” -> “” Hence Matched.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * [Please note, for simplicity I did not wrote all the paths, when ever we hit “*” we have two path.]
     * <p>
     * Now lets come to more difficult pattern; where you have like this “**…*” or “.*” Or “..*” or “.**” … like this
     * We can assume it same as “.*” -> “$*” where $ represent any character, now again your problem reduce to same, isn’t it 
     * <p>
     * Last but not least, there is one special case like
     * Text =”abc” and pattern =”a*df”
     * In this case we need to look before what was the solution as there is no character previous to “*”.
     * <p>
     * Let’s write a recurrence relation and base case.
     * <p>
     * Base case:
     * If both string are empty = True
     * If one of them is empty but other is not = False.
     * <p>
     * Let’s Say
     * M[i][j] Defines the our solution dp.
     * ‘true’ when we can match 0 to i character of text are tested against 0 to j character of pattern and they match
     * Otherwise ‘False’
     * <p>
     * Text[i-1] == Pattern[j-1] ; Then we need to look back what was state when current character don’t exist => M[i-1][j-1]
     * <p>
     * Text[i-1] != Pattern[j-1]; Now there could be following reason that they are not equal
     * 1.	The character at both are different like Text[i-1] = ‘A’ and Pattern[j-1] = ‘B’ => False
     * 2.	The character at pattern is ‘.’  => True
     * 3.	The character at pattern is “*” => Look back either 2 character before (assume previous character don’t exist Or 1 character before assume at least 1 occurrence is there of previous character. Now previous character could be “.” Or a character
     * If “.” Then it can match to any one Or if both character match then What was the last state of text matching pattern, which is M[i-1][j]
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * M[i][j]  = {
     * Text[i-1] == Pattern[j-1] => M[i-1][j-1]
     * Text[i-1] != Pattern[j-1] and Pattern[j-1]!=’.’ and Pattern[j-1]!=’* => False
     * Pattern[j-1] == ‘.’ => M[i-1][j-1]
     * Pattern[j-1] == ‘*’ => M[i][j-2] | (if Pattern[j-2] == ‘.’ Or Pattern[j-2] == Text[i-1]) M[i-1][j]
     * <p>
     * 1   if p.charAt(j-1) != s.charAt(i) : dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-2]  //in this case, a* only counts as empty
     * 2   if p.charAt(i-1) == s.charAt(i) or p.charAt(i-1) == '.':
     * dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]    //in this case, a* counts as multiple a
     * or dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]   // in this case, a* counts as single a
     * or dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-2]   // in this case, a* counts as empty
     *
