 * Author: Nitin Gupta
 * Date: 2019-07-21
 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-subarrays-with-bounded-maximum/
 *
 *
 * We are given an array A of positive integers, and two positive integers L and R (L <= R).
 *
 * Return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is at least L and at most R.
 *
 * Example :
 * Input:
 * A = [2, 1, 4, 3]
 * L = 2
 * R = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: There are three subarrays that meet the requirements: [2], [2, 1], [3].
 * Note:
 *
 * L, R  and A[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
 * The length of A will be in the range of [1, 50000].
 *
 * Solution: {@link NumberSubArraysBoundedMaximum}
