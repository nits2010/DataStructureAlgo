 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/reaching-points/
 * 780. Reaching Points [hard]
 * <p>
 * A move consists of taking a point (x, y) and transforming it to either (x, x+y) or (x+y, y).
 * <p>
 * Given a starting point (sx, sy) and a target point (tx, ty), return True if and only if a sequence of moves exists to transform the point (sx, sy) to (tx, ty). Otherwise, return False.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 3, ty = 5
 * Output: True
 * Explanation:
 * One series of moves that transforms the starting point to the target is:
 * (1, 1) -> (1, 2)
 * (1, 2) -> (3, 2)
 * (3, 2) -> (3, 5)
 * <p>
 * Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 2, ty = 2
 * Output: False
 * <p>
 * Input: sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 1, ty = 1
 * Output: True
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * sx, sy, tx, ty will all be integers in the range [1, 10^9].
 * <p>

/**
 * If you observe that you have two actions to take at any moment for (x,y)
 * 1. (x , x+y)
 * 2. (x+y, y)
 * That means, we can have two choices at (x,y) which forms it like a binary tree. And one of the leaf node probably consist the (tx, ty)
 * <p>
 * Brute force:
 * 1. Do same as ask, run from top to bottom of binary tree. Find the leaf node which satisfy the condition.
 * sx=1, sy=1, tx=3, ty=5
 * *
 * *                            [1,1]
 * *                      [1,2]                  [2,1]
 * *             [1,3]           [3,2]
 * *                          [3,5] <- solution
 * *
 * *
 * *  Complexity: The height of binary tree depends on tx,ty. All the values which are either greater then tx or ty will be discarded as from that we can't reach the tx,ty.
 * * Hence, the height of tree would be Max(tx,ty)= N ..total complexity O(2^N)

/**
 * In above approach, we need to drill down till the tx or ty. If you see, for each child, there is only 1 way to reach parent (eventually root) in binary tree.
 * Which means, instead of starting from (sx,sy) and go down, we can start from (tx,ty) and go up till you hit one of the condition like sx >= tx or sy>= ty {revers of top down condition}
 * then you from that point you can simply check does it is possible to reach or not.
 * <p>
 * or sx=1, sy=1, tx=3, ty=5
 * *   [3,5] -> [3,2] = [1,2] here sx==tx
 * now we met the base condition, [1,2] can only be translate for [1,1] when ty >= sy {2>1} and (ty-sy)%sx == 0 { (2-1)%1 == 0}
 * <p>
 * why (ty-sy)%sx == 0?
 * since
 * sy will translate to ty only by (sx+sy), if they translate then (sx, sy+k*sx) = ty  for some k
 * sy+k*sx = ty => (ty-sy) / sx = k.
 * Since sx,sy,tx,ty are all integer, then k has to be a integer which means, there must be a integer k that help us to reach ty.
 * Hence
 * (ty-sy) % sx == 0
 * *
 * O(log(n)) ; n=Max(tx,ty)
 * Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Reaching Points.
 * Memory Usage: 33 MB, less than 12.50% of Java online submissions for Reaching Points.
