 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-zig-zag-subsequence/
 * <p>
 * A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly
 * alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative.
 * A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.
 * <p>
 * For example, [1,7,4,9,2,5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative.
 * In contrast, [1,4,7,2,5] and [1,7,4,5,5] are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive
 * and the second because its last difference is zero.
 * <p>
 * Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence.
 * A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence,
 * leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
 * Output: 2
 * Follow up:
 * Can you do it in O(n) time?

         *
         * The first recurrence relation is based on the fact that, If we are at position i and this element has to bigger
         * than its previous element then for this sequence (upto i) to be bigger we will try to choose an element j ( < i)
         * such that A[j] < A[i] i.e. A[j] can become A[i]â€™s previous element and Z[j][1] + 1 is bigger than Z[i][0]
         * then we will update Z[i][0].
         * Remember we have chosen Z[j][1] + 1 not Z[j][0] + 1 to satisfy alternate property because in Z[j][0] last element
         * is bigger than its previous one and A[i] is greater than A[j] which will break the alternating property if we update.
         * So above fact derives first recurrence relation, similar argument can be made for second recurrence relation also
