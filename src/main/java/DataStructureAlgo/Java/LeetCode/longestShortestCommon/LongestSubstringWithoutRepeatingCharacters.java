 * 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters [ Medium ]
 * <p>
 * Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: "abcabcbb"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: "bbbbb"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: "pwwkew"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
 * Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

/**
 * In above solution, we keep count of every character in 'chars' that made
 * us to have a while loop to reduce the count.
 * We can optimize it further by realizing the fact that once a character at 'j' occurred again, say at index 'i'
 * Then all the character from [s...i]; s<i;  can't be part of new potential sub-string. We can simply discard
 * all those chars in between and jump directly just next character of last occurrence of it which is i+1.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * 0    1   2   3   4   5   6   7
 * p    w   w   p   k   e   k   w
 * <p>
 * Lets say
 * j=6 then we know that we have seen this at i=4 s.t. s=2 {w p k e}
 * if we include j'th char then it becomes {w p k e k} which violates the condition. Now the string from [s,i]-> {w p k}
 * can't be the part of new potential sub-string (why? because if it is so, then k will be repeated twice )
 * hence we'll consider the string from i+1 onwards {e k} as new potential string
