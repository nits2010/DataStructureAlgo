 * Author: Nitin Gupta
 * Date: 2019-08-15
 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-with-multiplicity/
 * <p>
 * Given an integer array A, and an integer target, return the number of tuples i, j, k  such that i < j < k and A[i] + A[j] + A[k] == target.
 * <p>
 * As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: A = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5], target = 8
 * Output: 20
 * Explanation:
 * Enumerating by the values (A[i], A[j], A[k]):
 * (1, 2, 5) occurs 8 times;
 * (1, 3, 4) occurs 8 times;
 * (2, 2, 4) occurs 2 times;
 * (2, 3, 3) occurs 2 times.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: A = [1,1,2,2,2,2], target = 5
 * Output: 12
 * Explanation:
 * A[i] = 1, A[j] = A[k] = 2 occurs 12 times:
 * We choose one 1 from [1,1] in 2 ways,
 * and two 2s from [2,2,2,2] in 6 ways.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * 3 <= A.length <= 3000
 * 0 <= A[i] <= 100
 * 0 <= target <= 300
 * <p>
 * Extension of {@link ThreeSum3Sum}

     * Sorted-> [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5]
     * <p>
     * Important observation: As the elements are get sorted, that brings all the duplicate pair together.
     * Essentially those duplicate pair will also contribute in our solution.
     * The one way is to count each of them one by one Or we can simply do some maths.
     * <p>
     * We can count how many of them are duplicate for a 'i'th element.
     * let say from the side of j there are 2 and from k there are 3 then we essentially have 2*3 pairs
     * Example:
     * i=1 [0 index]
     * j = 2 [2 index]
     * k = 5 [12]
     * <p>
     * Hence j has duplicates  till index 4 while k has till 10
     * In total  x-> for j and y->k
     * x = 2 and y = 3
     * then there will be 2*3 pairs with current i, as we can choose all the permutation
     * indices- > [0,2,12] , [0,2,11] , [0,2,10] , [0,3,12] , [0,3,11] [0,3,10] = 6 pairs
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * but there is a special case when both element at j and k are equal
     * [3,4,4,4,4] here i->3 and j->4 [from left] and k-> 4 [from right]
     * Then above equation will fail.
     * So we can simply count how many are them by counting them it self
     * here z = 4 [ 4 count of 4 ]
     * At any moment we can select 2 of as j and k hence there will be 4C2 = 12 pairs
