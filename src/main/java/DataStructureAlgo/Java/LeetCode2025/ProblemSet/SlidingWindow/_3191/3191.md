# Minimum K-Bit Flips to Make All Elements 1
[important]Read this article for better learning https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-k-consecutive-bit-flips/editorial
## Problem Statement

Given a binary array `nums`, and an integer `k`, return the **minimum number of k-bit flips** needed to convert all values in the array to 1s.

Each flip operation inverts exactly `k` contiguous elements (from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`). If it is not possible to do so, return `-1`.
here k=3

## Intuition

Flipping bits in-place and directly will lead to repeated toggling of elements and inefficient time complexity.

Instead, we use a **greedy + prefix sum technique** with a **difference array** to simulate flip influence over a window.

The core idea is:

- Instead of flipping each bit physically, we track the effect of a flip on future indices using a difference array (`diff[]`).
- This helps us know whether a current position has been flipped even or odd times, without changing the original array.
- We flip **only when necessary** (i.e., when the current bit after considering previous flips is still `0`).
- Each flip starts at index `i` and affects `i` to `i + k - 1`.
- We simulate the effect of that flip with:
    - `flip ^= 1` at the start.
    - `diff[i + k] ^= 1` to cancel the effect after the window.

---

## Approach

We maintain:

- `flip` → Current flip state (0 or 1), indicating if the current position has been flipped odd times so far.
- `diff[]` → Difference array of size `n + 1` to apply and revert flip influence.
- `flipCount` → Total flips performed.

At each index `i`:

1. **Update flip state:**  
   `flip ^= diff[i]` — apply any previous flip ending here.

2. **Check effective bit:**  
   If `(nums[i] ^ flip) == 0`, it's a `0`, so we must flip here.

3. **Flip window [i, i+k):**
    - If `i + k > n`, it's out of bounds → return `-1`
    - Update `flip ^= 1` (start new flip)
    - Mark cancel at `diff[i + k] ^= 1`
    - Increment `flipCount`

## Step-by-Step Example

### Input:

```java
nums = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
k = 3
```

### Simulation Table:

| Index | flip | diff[]               | nums[i] ^ flip | Action                    | flipCount |
|-------|------|----------------------|----------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| 0     | 0    | [0,0,0,0,0,0]        | 0              | Flip at 0 → diff[3] ^= 1  | 1         |
| 1     | 1    | [0,0,0,1,0,0]        | 1              | No flip                   | 1         |
| 2     | 1    | [0,0,0,1,0,0]        | 1              | No flip                   | 1         |
| 3     | 0    | [0,0,0,1,0,0]        | 1              | No flip                   | 1         |
| 4     | 0    | [0,0,0,1,0,0]        | 0              | Not enough space → -1     | -         |



## Why It Works
* A flip at index i affects exactly k elements: [i, i+k)

* To avoid modifying the array repeatedly, we track flip influence and its expiration using prefix-style XOR.

* The difference array acts like a flip-schedule: we add a flip at index i, and cancel it at index i + k.
