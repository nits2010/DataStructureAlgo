# Overview
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, our task is to return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, we have to return 0.

# Approach: Sliding Window

## Intuition
An intuitive technique is to go through all the subarrays one by one and check the sum of each one. If the total of the subarray under consideration is larger than or equal to `target`, we attempt to update our answer variable by using the minimum of the current answer and the length of this subarray. To get all the subarrays, we can run two loops: the outer loop selects a starting point and the inner loop selects an ending point. This solution, however, will take O(n^2) time, resulting in a time limit exceeded (TLE).

Let's think whether we really need to iterate over all the subarrays.

Given that we only have positive integers, there is no purpose in adding further elements to a subarray if its sum exceeds or equals `target`. Adding more elements to such a subarray will result in the construction of longer subarrays, which is useless because we have already found a smaller subarray that meets our requirements.

Only if the sum of the current subarray under consideration is smaller than `target`, we should append elements to the subarray. When the sum of the subarray exceeds or equals `target`, we will attempt to update our answer with the length of the current subarray.

We now try to remove the elements from the start and see if we can form a smaller subarray that meets our requirements. We remove the first element from the subarray and check if we still have the total higher than or equal to `target`. If the total exceeds or equals `target`, we have a smaller subarray that meets our requirement. As a result, we again try to update our answer with the length of the current subarray and repeat the process of eliminating the first element from the current subarray until the sum no longer exceeds or equals `target`.

Now after removing elements, if the sum of the subarray is less than `target`, we have to append more elements to it until the sum becomes larger than or equal to `target`. We append elements until the sum equals or exceeds `target`, then try to update our answer variable and repeat the process of eliminating the first element.

The above approach can be efficiently solved using the sliding window approach.

A sliding window is achieved by using two pointers `left` and `right`, which point to the starting and ending indices of the subarray. We set them to a value of 0.

To "add" elements to the window, we loop over the array by incrementing `right`. In this problem, if the sum of the window exceeds or equals `target`, we try to update our answer and then "remove" elements from the window by incrementing `left` until the sum is less than `target` again.


### Algorithm
1. **Initialize Variables**:
    - `minSize` to store the minimal length of the subarray, initialized to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
    - `left` and `right` pointers to define the window, both initialized to `0`.
    - `sum` to keep track of the sum of elements within the window, initialized to `0`.
    - `n` to store the length of the input array `nums`.

2. **Expand the Window**:
    - Use a while loop to expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and adding the element at `right` to `sum`.
    - Continue expanding the window until `sum` is greater than or equal to `target`.

3. **Shrink the Window**:
    - Once `sum` is greater than or equal to `target`, use a nested while loop to shrink the window by moving the `left` pointer.
    - Update `minSize` with the minimum of the current `minSize` and the length of the current window (`right - left`).
    - Subtract the element at `left` from `sum` and increment `left`.

4. **Return Result**:
    - After processing the entire array, check if `minSize` has been updated. If not, return `0`. Otherwise, return `minSize`.


## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity `O(n)`
The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(n)`. We iterate through the array only once. Each iteration takes `O(n)` time.
### Space Complexity `O(1)`
The space complexity of the algorithm is `O(1)`. We only use a variable to store the result.
