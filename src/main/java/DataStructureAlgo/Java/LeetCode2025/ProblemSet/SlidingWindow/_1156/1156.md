# Longest Repeated Character Substring with One Swap Allowed
- [Ref](https://github.com/doocs/leetcode/blob/main/solution/1100-1199/1156.Swap%20For%20Longest%20Repeated%20Character%20Substring/README_EN.md)
## Problem Summary

You are given a string `text`. You can swap two characters in the text. Return the length of the longest substring containing repeated characters after one such swap.

### Example 1:
```
Input: text = "ababa"
Output: 3
Explanation: Swap the first 'b' with the last 'a' → "aaaba", resulting in a maximum repeated character substring "aaa".
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: text = "aaabaaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Swap 'b' with the last 'a' → "aaaaaa".
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: text = "aaaaa"
Output: 5
Explanation: No swap needed. The entire string is already repeated characters.
```

## Approach Explanation

### Key Insight:

We need to find the longest substring such that:
- It contains **only two different characters**.
- **Only one of the characters can appear once**.
- If **both** characters appear only once, or if there are **more than two different characters**, the substring is **invalid**.

Tracking character frequencies using a `Map` might seem intuitive but becomes complex when validating the window on every move.

### Simplification:

We make a critical observation:

A valid substring can take one of the following forms:
1. A block of the same character, followed by a different character (once), followed again by the same block.
    - Example: `XXXXYXXXX`
2. A single character followed by a block of repeating characters.
    - Example: `YXXXXX`
3. A block followed by a single character.
    - Example: `XXXXXY`

As soon as a **third different character** appears, the substring becomes **invalid**.

### Strategy with Three Pointers:

We maintain three pointers:
- `i`: Start of the window.
- `j`: Moves from `i` to find the first different character from `s[i]`.
- `k`: Moves from `j` to find a third different character.

Example:

```
s = X X X X Y X X X X L
    ↑       ↑         ↑
    i       j         k

s = Y X X X X X X L
    ↑ ↑           ↑
    i j           k
```

- The window from index `i` to `k - 1` is **valid**.
- Its length is `k - i`.
- Record or update the max length so far.

When we detect an invalid window (i.e., character at `k` differs from both `s[i]` and `s[j]`), reset `i = j` and repeat.

### Validating Swaps

We must ensure that the character being repeated in the substring has **at least one more instance available** in the original string. Otherwise, even if the window structure looks valid, we can't perform a valid swap.

#### Example 1:

```
s = aaaabaaaac
'a' → 8, 'b' → 1, 'c' → 1

Window: "aaaa" (length 4)  
Can we extend? Yes → total 'a' in string = 8 → 4 < 8 → Valid

Window: "aaaabaaaa" (length 8)  
Can we extend? No → 8 == total 'a' in string → No extra 'a' to swap → Invalid
```

#### Example 2:

```
s = aaaabaaaaca
'a' → 9, 'b' → 1, 'c' → 1

Window: "aaaabaaaa" (length 8)  
Can we extend? Yes → 8 < 9 → One more 'a' exists → Valid
```

### Hence:

We use:
```java
Math.min(windowLength, counts[temp[i] - 'a'])
```
To cap the repeated block by the number of total available characters.

This ensures we never over-count beyond the actual frequency of the character, making the algorithm both **correct** and **efficient**.
