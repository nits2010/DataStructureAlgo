# Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

## Problem
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the length of the longest substring of `s` such that the frequency of each character in the substring is at least `k`.

---

## Approach: Divide and Conquer

1. **Count character frequencies** for the current substring `[start, end]`.
2. **Check**:
    - If all characters occur at least `k` times â†’ current substring is valid â†’ return its length.
3. **If not**:
    - Find the first invalid character (frequency < k).
    - **Split** the string at this invalid character.
    - Recursively solve the two resulting substrings.
    - Take the maximum length from the two splits.

**Key Detail:**  
We **exclude** the invalid character during recursion, ensuring progress and no recomputation.

## Detailed Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- **Character frequency counting** takes O(26) = O(1) time per substring (only lowercase letters).
- **Split point scanning** takes O(n) in total across all recursion levels.
- Even in the worst case (e.g., string with all unique characters), each character leads to a recursive split.
- The **total work** across all recursion calls is **O(n)** because:
    - Each character is processed at most once per recursion path.
    - Substrings become smaller after each split.

âœ… **Overall Time Complexity: O(n)**

---

### Space Complexity

- **Auxiliary Space**: O(26) = O(1) for character frequency array.
- **Recursion Stack Space**: O(n) in the worst case (e.g., every character is split separately).

âœ… **Overall Space Complexity: O(n)**

---

## Special Cases

- If `k <= 1`, the entire string is automatically valid â†’ return length of `s`.
- If `n == 0` or `n < k`, no valid substring possible â†’ return 0.
- If all characters satisfy frequency â‰¥ k, the whole substring is the answer.

---

## Why Time is O(n) Even in Worst Case?

Even if every character causes a split (like string `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"`):

- Each character is considered once in the divide phase.
- Work done per level is proportional to the size of substring.
- The recursion forms a "skinny" tree (almost like a linked list), **not a full binary tree**.
- Hence, no repeated work â€” total time remains **linear**.

### Why Time Complexity is O(n) for "Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters"

---

## Core Idea

Although the recursive approach **splits** the string multiple times, the total amount of work done across all recursive calls remains **linear** â€” **O(n)**.

Hereâ€™s why:

---

## 1. Each Character Processed Once

- Every character in the string is **checked** and possibly used as a split point at most **once** during the entire recursion.
- Once a split happens at an invalid character (character frequency < k), that character is **excluded** from further recursion.
- Therefore, no character is **revisited** unnecessarily.

---

## 2. Work Per Level is Proportional to Substring Length

- For any substring, we:
    - Count character frequencies â†’ O(26) = O(1).
    - Traverse through substring to find invalid characters â†’ O(length of substring).
- Even though we split, **total work across all splits at a level is proportional to the size of the substring**.
- Hence, the sum of work across all recursion levels is **O(n)**.

---

## 3. Even in Worst Case (Unique Characters)

- Example: `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"` (26 unique characters).
- Every character causes a split.
- Recursion forms a **"skinny" tree**, **NOT** a full binary tree.
- Total number of operations still grows **linearly** with the size of the input string.

---

## 4. No Repeated Computation

- We do not recompute character frequencies for overlapping substrings.
- Each split processes a **disjoint** substring.

Thus, **no extra work** beyond proportional to the original string size.

---

## âœ… Final Summary

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) â€” Each character leads to at most one operation per recursion path.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) â€” Due to recursion stack in the worst case.

This makes the divide and conquer solutionSlidingWindow extremely efficient for this problem.

# Sliding Window Approach
## How to Realize We Need to Try All Unique Character Counts (Sliding Window Approach)

## ðŸ§  Step-by-Step Intuition

### 1. Problem Nature: Frequency Matters
- The problem is about **frequencies**:
  > Find the longest substring where **each character appears at least `k` times**.
- It's not about order or specific characters, but **how often** characters appear.
- **Frequency per character** is key.

---

### 2. Observation: Bad Characters Split the Problem
- If a character appears **less than `k` times**, it **cannot** be part of a valid substring.
- This naturally hints at **splitting** around "bad" characters (divide & conquer approach).

---

### 3. Iterative Approach with Sliding Window
- Instead of recursion, we want to **slide a window** while maintaining a property.
- In typical sliding window problems, you **control**:
    - Number of unique characters
    - Frequency constraints
- Examples:
    - *Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters*
    - *Longest Substring with Exactly K Distinct Characters*

Thus, controlling **unique character count** seems a useful idea here too.

---

### 4. Critical Realization
- A valid substring must have:
    - Some **number of unique characters**
    - **And** every character inside the window must have **frequency â‰¥ k**.

Thus:
- Try with 1 unique character.
- Try with 2 unique characters.
- Try with 3 unique characters.
- ...
- Up to 26 (total lowercase English letters).

âœ… **Key:** Fixing the number of unique characters provides a manageable way to slide the window.

---

### 5. Why It Is Acceptable to Try All Unique Counts
- There are only **26 lowercase English letters**.
- So **trying 1 to 26 unique character targets** is computationally cheap.
- For each target, you can efficiently use a **sliding window** to find the best substring satisfying the constraints.

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Strategy

| Step | Intuition |
|:-----|:----------|
| 1 | Frequency matters â†’ track character counts |
| 2 | Bad characters break substrings |
| 3 | Sliding window needs controllable metric |
| 4 | Unique character count is controllable |
| 5 | Try all 1 to 26 unique character counts |

---

## ðŸš€ Bonus Tip
When you see:
- **Frequency-based constraints**, and
- **Bounded unique elements** (like 26 letters),

it is often smart to:
- **Try all possible unique counts** (brute-force over unique counts),
- **And use sliding window** to maximize performance inside each trial.
