### Intuition and Algorithm for `minWindow`
[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/solutions/5883951/easy-solutionMimicPQ-in-full-details-sliding-window-beat-100)
#### Intuition
The objective is to find the smallest substring in `s` that contains all the characters of `t` (including duplicates). Using a sliding window approach allows us to efficiently track the characters needed and found, adjusting the window as we go.


## Approach: Sliding Window + Frequency Map [ Prefered ]

This problem is solved optimally using a **sliding window** technique combined with **character frequency counting**.

---

## Key Insight

- **Duplicates are handled by frequency matching**, not by counting characters individually.
- We track:
  - What characters are required
  - How many of those requirements are currently satisfied

---

## Definitions

- `need`: Frequency map of characters in `t`
- `window`: Frequency map of current sliding window in `s`
- `required`: Number of **distinct characters** in `t`
- `formed`: Number of characters whose required frequency is met in the current window

> Even when duplicates exist, `required = len(need)` is correct because  
> duplicates are enforced via frequency comparison (`window[ch] == need[ch]`).

---

## Algorithm Steps

1. Build a frequency map `need` from string `t`
2. Initialize two pointers `start` and `end`
3. Expand the window by moving `end`
4. Update window frequencies and `formed`
5. When `formed == required`, try shrinking the window from the left
6. Track the smallest valid window found
7. Return the minimum window substring

#### Approach 2
1. **Frequency Counting**:
    - Use two arrays to keep track of character frequencies:
        - `shouldFind` to count the required frequencies of characters in `t`.
        - `hasFind` to count the frequencies of characters within the current window of `s`.

2. **Sliding Window**:
    - Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current window in `s`.
    - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and include characters until a valid window is found (contains all characters of `t`).
    - Once a valid window is found, try to minimize it by moving the `left` pointer inward while keeping the window valid.

3. **Track Minimum Window**:
    - Keep track of the minimum window length and its start and end indices.
    - Update these values whenever a smaller valid window is found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
    - If `s` or `t` is empty, return an empty string.
    - If no valid window is found, return an empty string.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialize the frequency arrays `shouldFind` and `hasFind`.
2. Populate `shouldFind` with the frequency of each character in `t`.
3. Initialize variables for the window (`left`, `right`), character count `counts`, and the result (`minLength`, `start`, `end`).
4. Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer:
    - If the character is necessary (`shouldFind[ch] > 0`), update `hasFind`.
    - If adding the character keeps the window valid (`hasFind[ch] <= shouldFind[ch]`), increment `counts`.
    - When `counts` equals the length of `t`, move the `left` pointer inward to minimize the window:
        - Adjust `hasFind` and `left` until the window is no longer valid.
        - Update `minLength`, `start`, and `end` if a smaller valid window is found.
5. Return the smallest valid window substring or an empty string if no valid window is found.
