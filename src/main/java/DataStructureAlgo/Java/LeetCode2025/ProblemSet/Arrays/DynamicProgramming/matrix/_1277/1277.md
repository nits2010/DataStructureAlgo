# Approach and Intuition

## Problem

Given a binary matrix, count the number of square submatrices with all ones.

## Intuition

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: Use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the size of the largest square submatrix with all ones that ends at `(i, j)`.
2. **Counting Squares**: By iterating over the matrix and updating the DP array, sum up the values in the DP array to get the total count of square submatrices.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Define a 2D DP array `dp` with the same dimensions as the input matrix.
    - Initialize the DP array with the same values as the input matrix.

2. **DP Transition**:
    - Iterate through the matrix starting from the second row and second column.
    - For each cell `(i, j)`, if `matrix[i][j] == 1`, update `dp[i][j]` to be the minimum of:
        - `dp[i-1][j-1]` (top-left diagonal)
        - `dp[i-1][j]` (top)
        - `dp[i][j-1]` (left)
          plus one.
    - Keep a running total of the squares counted.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
    - Initialize the first row and first column separately, as they don't have upper or left neighbors.

## Example

Consider the following matrix:

 ```
[0,1,1,1],
[1,1,1,1],
[0,1,1,1]
 ```

- **Initial DP Array, Post Fill**:

    ```
    [0,1,1,1],
    [1,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0]
     ```

- **DP Array after updates**:
     ```
    [0,1,1,1],
    [1,1,2,2],
    [0,1,2,3]
     ```
  Total squares = 1 (10 times) + 2 (3 time) + 3 (1 time) = 10 + 2 + 3 = 15.

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: `O(N*M)` where `N` is the number of rows and `M` is the number of columns.
- **DP Update and Count**: `O(N*M)`.
- **Total**: `O(N*M)`.
