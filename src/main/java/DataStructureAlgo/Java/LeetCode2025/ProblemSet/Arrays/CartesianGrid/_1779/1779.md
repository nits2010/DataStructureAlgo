# Nearest Valid Point

## Intuition

The problem requires finding the nearest valid point to a given coordinate `(x, y)` from a list of points. A point is considered valid if it shares either the same x-coordinate or y-coordinate with the given point. The distance metric used is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.

if either of them (`x/y)` matches the point, then its `dx` or `dy` will be `zero`.
Hence, `dx*dy = 0`
Manhattan distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is` abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)` which is `abs(dx) + abs(dy)`

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Check if the input `points` array is null or empty. If so, return `-1` as there are no valid points to consider.
    - Initialize `index` to `-1` to keep track of the index of the nearest valid point. If no valid point is found, this will be the return value.
    - Initialize `smallestDistance` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to store the smallest Manhattan distance found.

2. **Iterate Through Points**:
    - Loop through each point in the `points` array.
    - For each point, check if it shares the same x-coordinate or y-coordinate with the given point `(x, y)`.
        - If either coordinate matches, calculate the Manhattan distance between the given point and the current point.
        - If the calculated distance is smaller than `smallestDistance`, update `smallestDistance` and set `index` to the current point's index.

3. **Return Result**:
    - After iterating through all points, return the `index` of the nearest valid point. If no valid point was found, `index` will be `-1`.

### Complexity Analysis
#### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of points in the input array. We iterate through each point once to find the nearest valid point.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(1)` as we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables like `index` and `smallestDistance`.
