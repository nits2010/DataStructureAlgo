### Intuition, Approach, and Example Walkthrough for `minCapability`
[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iv/solutions/5959360/develop-though-process-detailed-explanation-of-bs-idea)
#### Intuition
The problem is to find the minimum capability required to rob exactly `k` houses without robbing two adjacent houses.
# Robbery Problem: Minimum of Maximum Capability

The goal is to find the **minimum of the maximum capability** — the maximum stolen item from a single robbed house, given certain constraints on how the robber can rob the houses.

### Understanding the Problem

1. **Case 1: k = 1 (Only 1 house can be robbed)**
    - If the robber can rob only one house, the solution is simply the **minimum value** of the array (the least valuable house), because robbing just one house would minimize the potential maximum.

2. **Case 2: k = n (All houses can be robbed)**
    - If the robber can rob all houses, the solution would be the **maximum value** of the array, as the robber would eventually rob the house with the highest value.

3. **Constraints Case: 1 ≤ k ≤ n/2 (Cannot rob adjacent houses)**
    - The robber cannot rob adjacent houses, meaning they can rob up to `k` houses, but must skip at least one house between two robbed houses.

### Key Idea

This problem can be framed as finding the minimum value of the maximum stolen item for various strategies of robbing houses. The robber's **minimum capability** lies between the **minimum** and **maximum** values of the array.

### Approach: Binary Search

Since the robber's capability lies within a range (`min` to `max` of the array), we can use **binary search** to determine the solution. The challenge is to know how many houses can be robbed for a given `mid` value in our binary search.

### Binary Search Strategy:

1. **If the maximum house value exceeds `mid`**:
    - The robber is robbing too many houses, which is outside the allowed range. Reduce the search range to `[low, mid-1]`.

2. **If the maximum house value is less than `mid`**:
    - The robber is not robbing enough houses, so we need to increase the range to `[mid+1, high]`.

3. **If the robber robs exactly `k` houses**:
    - We need to minimize the value of `mid`, so the range is reduced to `[low, mid]`.



#### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**:
    - Determine the minimum (`min`) and maximum (`max`) values in the `nums` array to set the range `[min, max]`.
    - Initialize the `low` pointer to `min` and `high` pointer to `max`.

2. **Binary Search**:
    - Perform binary search on the range `[low, high]`.
    - Calculate the middle value, `mid`, of the current range.
    - Determine the number of houses that can be robbed with capability `mid` using the helper function `requireK(nums, k, mid)`.
    - If the number of houses that can be robbed (`requireK`) is exactly `k`, update `high` to `mid` to check for smaller values.
    - If `requireK` is greater than `k`, update `high` to `mid - 1`.
    - If `requireK` is less than `k`, update `low` to `mid + 1`.

3. **Return Result**:
    - Return the value of `low` which will be the minimum capability required to rob exactly `k` houses.

#### Helper Function (`requireK`)
- This function calculates the number of houses that can be robbed given a capability `mid`.
- Iterate through the `nums` array and count the number of houses with values less than or equal to `mid` while ensuring no two adjacent houses are robbed.
- Skip the next house whenever a house is robbed to ensure the adjacent rule is followed.
- Return the count of such 


### Time Complexity:

- The binary search is performed over the range of `[min, max]`, which gives a time complexity of `O(log(max))`.
- For each binary search operation, we are checking at most `n` houses, making the overall complexity `O(n * log(max))`.

## Problem with Greedy Taking
A "seemingly optimal" approach would be to consider all possibilities where we make a choice at each house to pick/not pick when choosing a total of k houses to rob.

Problem with Greedy Taking
Think of it like this:

What could be the problem with a greedy approach to taking/robbing houses?

When iterating through the houses, it might happen that because of having taken/robbed an earlier house, you miss out on being able to take the current house, which is needed in the "solution."

Proof: No Fear of Missing Out
We will prove that there will never be such a case. If a solution exists in the "optimal approach" with skipping one particular house, then it also exists if we had chosen that house when first encountered using the greedy approach.

Here, solution refers to whether or not a set S of non-consecutive sequences of k houses exists such that for all Si ∈ S , Si < midThreshold.

Let's take the house array H = { h1, h2, h3, ... , hn }.

Case Analysis
Let's assume that the optimal solution does not include h1, but our greedy solution has picked h1. Now, after picking h1, what possibilities are we left to choose from? We need to pick k-1 houses from the range [h3, hn] since we can't pick h2.

For the optimal solution, where we had skipped taking h1, we are left to choose k houses from [h2, hn].

If the optimal solution picks h2, then it is left to choose k-1 houses from [h4, hn].
If it doesn't pick h2, then it is left to choose k houses from [h3, hn].
In either case, the greedy solution's range of choosing k-1 houses from [h3, hn] overlaps with the remaining optimal solution.

Conclusion: No Fear of Missing Out
Using mathematical induction, we can keep on extending this to any hi. Therefore, there's no fear of missing out on future house-picking choices because we have picked an earlier house in the greedy approach.
