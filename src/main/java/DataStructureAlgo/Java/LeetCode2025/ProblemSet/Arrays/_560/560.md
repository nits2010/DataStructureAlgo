# [560. Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/description/)

This is similar
to [LongestSubArrayHavingSumK.md](..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2FGeeksForGeeks2025%2FProblemSet%2FArrays%2FSubArrays%2FLongestSubArrayHavingSumK.md)
The only difference here is that we need to count the subarrays that have sum equal to `k` instead the length.

## Intuition

The key observation here is that if the sum of elements from the start of the array to the current index `i`
is `prefixSum` and we know there exists an earlier prefix sum `prefixSum - k` at some index `j`, then the sum of the
elements between indices `j+1` and `i` is exactly `k`. This allows us to track the longest subarray satisfying this
condition. For all such sub-arrays, we will count them and keep in hashmap.

## Approach

The goal is to count the number of subarrays whose sum equals a given value `k`. This can be efficiently achieved using
a prefix sum approach. By maintaining a running sum of the elements and using a hashmap to store the count of each
prefix sum encountered, we can identify the number of subarrays that end at the current index and have a sum equal
to `k`.

1. **Initialize Variables**:
    - `count` to store the number of subarrays with sum equal to `k`, initialized to `0`.
    - A hashmap `map` to store pairs of cumulative sums and their counts.
    - `prefixSum` to keep track of the cumulative sum of elements as we iterate through the array.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
    - Add the current element to `prefixSum`.
    - If `prefixSum` is equal to `k`, increment `count` by `1`.
    - Check if `prefixSum - k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment `count` by the number of times this sum has
      been encountered, as it indicates there are subarrays that sum to `k` ending at the current index.
    - Store the current `prefixSum` in the hashmap, incrementing its count by `1`.

3. **Return the Result**:
    - Return `count`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we traverse the array once and each
  operation (insertion and lookup in the hashmap) is `O(1)` on average.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` to store the prefix sums and their indices in the hashmap.
