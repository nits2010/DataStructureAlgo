# [334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/description/)

## Problem
The problem is to determine if there exists a strictly increasing triplet subsequence within an integer array `nums`. That is, we need to find three indices `i < j < k` such that `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`.

## Intuition
The goal is to detect whether there exists a subsequence of length 3 that is strictly increasing. Instead of storing all possible subsequences or searching through all triplet combinations, 
we only need two variables (`min1` and `min2`) to capture the smallest and second-smallest elements encountered so far in the array. 
If we find a third element that is greater than both `min1` and `min2`, it confirms the presence of an increasing triplet.

### Key Idea:
1. **min1**: Tracks the smallest element encountered so far.
2. **min2**: Tracks the smallest element encountered that is larger than `min1`.
3. If we find an element greater than both `min1` and `min2`, then we have an increasing triplet.

## Approach
1. Initialize two variables, `min1` and `min2`, with a large initial value (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`).
2. Traverse through each element `n` in `nums`:
    - If `n` is smaller than or equal to `min1`, update `min1` to `n`.
    - Else, if `n` is smaller than or equal to `min2`, update `min2` to `n`.
    - If `n` is greater than `min2`, we have found an increasing triplet, and we return `true`.
3. If we complete the loop without finding a triplet, return `false`.

### Example Walkthrough
Consider the array `nums = [1, 2, 0, 3, 4]`.

| Step | `n` | `min1` | `min2` | Result               |
|------|-----|--------|--------|----------------------|
| 1    | 1   | 1      | ∞      | Initialize `min1` to 1 |
| 2    | 2   | 1      | 2      | `n > min1`, set `min2 = 2` |
| 3    | 0   | 0      | 2      | `n < min1`, update `min1 = 0` |
| 4    | 3   | 0      | 2      | `n > min2`, return `true` |

The loop stops at step 4, as we found an increasing triplet (`0, 2, 3`).

## Why does this work ? 
Here `min1` and `min2` does not represent the subsequence. So in given example;
`nums = [1, 2, 0, 3, 4]`.
There are following increasing triplets: 
1. `1, 2, 3`
2. `2, 3, 4`
3. `0, 3, 4`

our `min1=0` and `min2=2` does not represent the `2nd` subsequence as our program ends on step 4, element `3`. This only represents the smallest and the second-smallest elements in the subsequence. And at any moment 
we find another element (at greater index) then it will form increasing triplet. The reason of that is, min2 creates a mid element in the subsequence.
- If there’s no valid increasing triplet, min1 and min2 will get updated but never form a valid triplet with any element after them, resulting in the algorithm correctly returning false.
- If there exists an increasing triplet anywhere in the array, the algorithm will detect it by finding an element larger than min2, ensuring we don’t miss any valid triplet.


## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array. We only make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we use a fixed amount of extra space.

## Edge Cases
1. **Array Length Less than 3**: If `nums` has fewer than 3 elements, return `false` immediately, as it's impossible to form a triplet.
2. **Non-Increasing Arrays**: For arrays that are strictly decreasing or have no increasing triplet (e.g., `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`), the function should correctly return `false`.
3. **Duplicates and Mixed Values**: Arrays with repeated values or a mix of increasing and decreasing segments (e.g., `[2, 1, 5, 0, 4, 6]`) should return `true` only if a valid triplet exists.
