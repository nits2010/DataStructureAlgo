### Intuition, Approach, and Example Walkthrough for `rob`

#### Intuition
The problem is to determine the maximum amount of money you can rob from a binary tree, where the constraint is that you cannot rob two directly linked houses. This means if you rob a node (house), you cannot rob its immediate children, but you can rob its grandchildren and so on.

This makes the problem to be solved from bottom as we can propagate the maximum value from bottom to top. Now, to know
that current root can be included in the robbery or not, we need to know its children has been robbed or not. If both children are robbed with better amount, 
then current root can't be robbed and in such cases, we will take the maximum sum of two children (which include grandchildren, if any). 
And if we want to robb current root, then we have to pick either of the grandchildren only.

Hence, at any stage

`include = root.val + <exclude left child> + <exclude right child>`

`exclude = <either left root or its grandchildren> + <either right root or its grandchildren>`

This makes 
`include = root.val + left.exclude + right.exclude`

`exclude =  max(left.include, left.exclude) + max(right.include, right.exclude)`

#### Approach
1. **Define a Pair Class**:
    - A `Pair` class is used to store two values: `include` (money robbed including the current node) and `exclude` (money robbed excluding the current node).

2. **Postorder Traversal**:
    - Use a postorder traversal (left-right-root) to explore the tree. This ensures that for any node, the values of its children are already computed before the node itself.

3. **Recursive Function**:
    - If the node is `null`, return a `Pair(0, 0)` because there is nothing to rob.
    - If the node is a leaf, the only option is to rob it (`Pair(0, node.val)`).
    - For any other node, use the values computed for its left and right children to determine:
        - `include`: The value if we rob this node, which means we can't rob its immediate children.
          - `include = root.val + left.exclude + right.exclude`
        - `exclude`: The value if we don't rob this node, which means we can take the maximum of robbing or not robbing its children.
          - `exclude =  max(left.include, left.exclude) + max(right.include, right.exclude)`

4. **Calculate Maximum Profit**:
    - The maximum money that can be robbed from the tree rooted at the given node is the maximum of `include` and `exclude`.
