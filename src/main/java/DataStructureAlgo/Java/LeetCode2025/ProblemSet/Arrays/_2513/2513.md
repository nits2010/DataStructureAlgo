# Minimize Set Function

## Intuition
The goal is to find the smallest number `mid` such that we can fill two arrays with `uniqueCnt1` and `uniqueCnt2` unique numbers respectively, where the numbers in the first array are not divisible by `divisor1` and the numbers in the second array are not divisible by `divisor2`. We use binary search to efficiently find this minimum number.

## Note
Don't find the actual numbers being stored in any array but just count the minimum number you would require to meet the criteria mentioned in the question.


Find the following:

1. **For a given `n`, how many numbers are divisible by both `d1` and `d2`**:
    - These numbers would definitely not be placed in either of the arrays.
    - **How to calculate this?**
        - **Intuition**: For any number `n`, it can divide `n, 2n, 3n, 4n, ... xn`.
        - The number of numbers divisible by `n` from 1 to `x` would be `x / n`.
        - Therefore, to calculate the numbers that are divisible by both `d1` and `d2`, calculate the LCM of `d1` and `d2` and remove these many numbers from your calculations.

2. **For any given `n`, how many numbers are divisible by `d1`**:
    - These would be `n / d1`.
    - These numbers cannot be placed in `arr1` but can be placed in `arr2`.

3. **For any given `n`, how many numbers are divisible by `d2`**:
    - These would be `n / d2`.
    - These numbers cannot be placed in `arr2` but can be placed in `arr1`.

4. **Count the extra numbers required**:
    - Calculate the extra numbers needed to fill up the remaining capacity of the arrays.
    - If the capacity estimation is fulfilled, you have your answer.


## Approach
1. **Binary Search Setup**:
    - Initialize `low` to 1 and `high` to \(10^{10}\).
    - Use binary search to find the minimum `mid` that satisfies the conditions.

2. **Binary Search Execution**:
    - Calculate `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`.
    - Check if it is possible to fill both arrays with the given constraints using the `isPossible` function.
    - If possible, update `output` to `mid` and try to find a smaller valid `mid` by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.
    - If not possible, increase the range by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.

3. **Helper Functions**:
    - `isPossible`: Determines if it is possible to fill the arrays with the given constraints.
        - Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `divisor1` and `divisor2`.
        - Calculate the number of common elements divisible by both divisors.
        - Calculate the number of elements that can be uniquely assigned to each array.
        - Check if the remaining numbers are sufficient to meet the unique count requirements.
    - `lcm`: Computes the least common multiple of two numbers.
    - `gcd`: Computes the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(log N * log D)`
    - Binary search runs in `O(log N)`, where `N` is `10^10`.
    - Each check in `isPossible` involves calculating LCM and GCD, which takes `O(log D)`, where `D` is the maximum of `divisor1` and `divisor2`.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
    - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.
