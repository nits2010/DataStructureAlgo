# [2563. Count the Number of Fair Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-fair-pairs/description/)

## Intuition
The problem requires counting the number of fair pairs in an array where a pair `(i, j)` is considered fair if the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` falls within a given range `([lower, upper])`.
A pair (i, j) is fair if:
```
0 <= i < j < n, and
lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper
```

### Observations
We can observe that the constraint `0 <= i < j < n` holds true for any pair which follow `lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper`, hence the i and j order is not really matter. 
This implies that we can sort this array and reduce this `Two Sum Problem`. However, here we have two different target to meet, `lower` and `upper`. 
Our sum of two numbers should be in the range of `[lower, upper]`. Which can be translated to  `Two sum problem` as finding the number of pairs, whose `sum <= upper` and `sum >=lower`. 

This can be further simplifies as `Total = ( Pairs (sum <= upper) - Pairs( sum < lower) + Pairs (sum == lower) )`
Can be re-written as `Total = ( Pairs (sum <= upper) - Pairs( sum <= lower-1) )` Or `Total = ( Pairs (sum < upper+1) - Pairs( sum <= lower) )`


## Approach-TwoPointer

1. **Sorting**: First, we sort the array `nums`. Sorting helps in efficiently finding pairs using the two-pointer technique.

2. **Count Pairs Less Than a Target**:
    - We create a helper function `pairLessThanTarget` that calculates the number of pairs `i, j` for which `nums[i] + nums[j] <= target`.
    - We initialize two pointers: `i` at the beginning (`0`) and `j` at the end `(n-1)` of the sorted array.
    - As long as `i < j`, we check the sum `nums[i] + nums[j]`:
        - If the sum is less than or equal to the target, all pairs between `i` and `j` are valid (because the array is sorted). We then add `j-i` to the count and move the `i` pointer to the right.
        - If the sum is greater than the target, we move the `j` pointer to the left, reducing the sum.

3. **Calculate Fair Pairs**:
    - The number of fair pairs is the difference between the pairs with sums less than or equal to `upper` and the pairs with sums less than `lower`. This is because we want the sums to be within the range `[lower, upper]`.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
    - Sorting the array takes `O(n * log n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.
    - Each call to `pairLessThanTarget` runs in `O(n)`, as we traverse the array with two pointers.
    - The total time complexity is therefore `O(n * log n)` due to the sorting step, which dominates the linear scans.

- **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is `O(1)`, disregarding the space for input and output, as we use a constant amount of extra space.


## Approach 2: Binary Search

### Intuition

If you are not familiar with binary search, please refer to our explore cards [Binary Search Explore Card](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/binary-search/). We will focus on the usage in this article and not the underlying principles or implementation details.

We can iterate through the sorted array while keeping one element of the pair fixed. For each fixed element, we'll find out how many valid choices we have for the second element. Because the array is sorted, the first valid choice will give us a sum that is just greater than or equal to `lower`, and the last valid choice will yield a sum that is just less than or equal to `upper`. Since the sums increase steadily, all valid second elements will cluster together in the array.

To count the number of pairs with sums that fall within the range `[lower, upper]`, we can use a clever technique. First, we calculate how many pairs have sums that are less than `lower`. Then, we count how many pairs have sums that are less than `upper + 1`. By taking the difference between these two counts, we can easily determine how many pairs have sums within the desired range.

Now, how do we find the number of pairs for the lower limit using binary search? After fixing the first element `nums[i]`, the second element must be less than `lower - nums[i]` to keep the sum below `lower`. We can efficiently find how many elements meet this condition by performing a binary search in the array for values less than or equal to `lower - nums[i]`.

Similarly, we can find the number of elements that are less than or equal to `upper + 1 - nums[i]`. The difference between these two counts will give us the total number of valid pairs for that particular fixed element.

### Algorithm

Note: The typical way to calculate the midpoint is `(left + right) / 2`. However, a safer approach is to use `left + (right - left) / 2`. While both formulas yield the same result, the second method is safer because it prevents overflow by ensuring that no value larger than `right` is stored. In contrast, the first method can lead to overflow if `left` and `right` are very large.

#### Function - lower_bound(nums, low, high, element):

1. Initialize a loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`:
    - Calculate the middle index `mid` using the formula `low + (high - low) / 2`.
    - If `nums[mid]` is greater than or equal to `element`, adjust the `high` index to `mid - 1`.
    - Otherwise, adjust the `low` index to `mid + 1`.
2. Return the `low` index after the loop ends, which represents the lower bound position.

#### Main Function - countFairPairs(nums, lower, upper):

1. Sort the array `nums`.
2. Initialize a variable `ans` to 0, which will hold the count of valid pairs.
3. Iterate through each element in the sorted array using index `i`:
    - For each element `nums[i]`, determine the number of possible pairs with a sum less than `lower`:
        - Use `lower_bound` to find the index of the first element in the subarray `nums[i + 1]` to `nums[end]` that is greater than or equal to `lower - nums[i]`.
    - Similarly, determine the number of possible pairs with a sum less than or equal to `upper`:
        - Use `lower_bound` to find the index of the first element in the subarray that is greater than or equal to `upper - nums[i] + 1`.
4. The difference `high - low` gives the count of valid pairs with sums within the range `[lower, upper]` for the current element.
5. Update `ans` by adding the difference calculated.
6. After iterating through all elements, return the value of `ans`.



## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:

    - The total time complexity is therefore `O(n * log n)` due to the sorting step, and linear scan + BS.

- **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is `O(1)`, disregarding the space for input and output, as we use a constant amount of extra space.
