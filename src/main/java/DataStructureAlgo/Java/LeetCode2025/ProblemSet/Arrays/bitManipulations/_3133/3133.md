## Binary to Decimal Conversion and Observations

### Conversion Examples

#### Example 1:
For `n = 3` and `x = 4` output = `6`
- Binary of `x = 4` is `[100]`

| Binary  | Decimal |
|---------|---------|
| `100`   | 4       |
| `101`   | 5       |
| `110`   | 6       |

#### Example 2:
For `n = 2` and `x = 7`
- Binary of `x = 7` is `[111]`

| Binary   | Decimal |
|----------|---------|
| `1110`   | 14      |
| `1111`   | 15      |

#### Example 3:
For `n = 3` and `x = 21` (Binary `[10101]`)

| Binary   | Decimal |
|----------|---------|
| `10101`  | 21      |
| `10111`  | 23      |
| `11101`  | 29      |

## Observations
1. The result (`ans`) must be greater than `x`.
2. The set bits in the result (`ans`) are the same as in `x`.
3. `nums[0] >=x` and If all bits of `x` are `1`, then `nums[0]` will have an extra bit; otherwise, it is the same as `x`.
4. Setting the bit for the next number starts with nums[0] (as nums[0] is either x or greater than x).
5. To make the result minimum, we have to make sure that we set the most significant bit which is 0 in num[0]
6. To simplify, we need binary rep of both x and n.
7. Setting 0 to 1 will only happen when it's set in 'n-1' binary representation. The reason for choosing n-1 is that  0 <= i < n - 1 and our result stored in nums[n-1]



# Approach 1: Consecutive ORing

## Intuition

The challenge is that the array must be strictly increasing while ensuring that the AND of all the numbers stays as x.
For the AND of all numbers to remain x, every number in the array needs to include at least the same bits as x. This means the numbers in the array must retain the bitwise characteristics of x as we move from one element to the next.
The smallest valid number we can start with is x itself since including anything smaller would lose the bit pattern that defines x. From there, we need to build up the next elements while keeping the numbers strictly increasing. As long as the new number has the same relevant bits as x, the AND result will remain unchanged.
To achieve this, we take the current number and increment it. After incrementing, we force the new number to keep the bit pattern of x by applying a bitwise OR with x. This ensures that no bits from x are lost in the process, and we continue this until the last element is constructed. The result is the smallest last element that satisfies both conditions: strictly increasing order and preserving the AND operation result as x.

### Example

Take n = 3 and x = 4:

- Starting with x=4 (binary: 100), we need to find the smallest integer y such that y>4 and the bitwise AND of 4 and y remains 4. We apply the expression: `result = (result + 1) | x`.

- First Step:
    - result = 4 ⟹ result = (4 + 1) | 4 ⟹ result = 5 | 4 = 5
    - Confirming the AND condition: 4 & 5 = 4

- Second Step:
    - result = 5 ⟹ result = (5 + 1) | 4 ⟹ result = 6 | 4 = 6
    - Confirming the AND condition: 4 & 5 & 6 = 4

Thus, 6 is the smallest valid last element, ensuring that the array satisfies both the increasing order and the required AND condition.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize `result` with the value of x.
2. Iterate n - 1 times (since `result` is already initialized with x):
    - Increment `result` by 1.
    - Perform a bitwise OR operation between `result` and x, and store the result back in `result`.
3. After completing the iterations, return `result`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
    - The loop runs n-1 times and each iteration performs a constant number of operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
    - Only a few variables are used, and no additional data structures or recursive calls are involved.

# Approach 2: Bit Manipulation and Binary Construction

## Intuition

This approach digs deeper into the bit-level structure of the numbers. We begin by converting both x and n-1 into their binary forms.

The binary representation of x tells us which bits we need to preserve across all numbers, while the binary form of n-1 gives us the flexibility to fill in the gaps between consecutive numbers. We want to merge the bit structures of x and n-1 to build the smallest valid number that retains the necessary bits from x.

We loop through the binary bits of x, identifying positions where bits can be set to create valid numbers. At the same time, we insert bits from n-1 where allowed, ensuring that the bit manipulation results in numbers strictly larger than the previous ones. The final number is constructed by combining the bits from both x and n-1, keeping the AND result consistent.

### Example

Take n = 3 and x = 4:

- We start with x = 4 (binary: 100) and check the bits of n-1 = 2 (binary: 010).
    - At position 2, x has a 1, meaning we must preserve this bit.
    - At position 1, x has a 0, allowing us to use the bit from n-1, which is 1.
    - At position 0, both x and n-1 have 0, so we keep it unset.
- The combined binary result is 110 (which is 6 in decimal).

### Algorithm

1. Initialize `result` as 0 to store the final result, and a variable `bit` for bit manipulation.
2. Decrease n by 1 to exclude x from the iteration.
3. Initialize two arrays, `binaryX` and `binaryN`, each of size 64 to hold the binary representation of x and n-1, respectively.
4. Convert x and n-1 to long long for 64-bit manipulation.
5. Build the binary representations for both x and n-1:
    - For each bit position i from 0 to 63:
        - Extract the i-th bit of x and store it in `binaryX[i]`.
        - Extract the i-th bit of n-1 and store it in `binaryN[i]`.
6. Initialize two pointers, `posX` and `posN`, to 0 to keep track of the current bit positions in `binaryX` and `binaryN`.
7. Traverse the binary representation of x (`binaryX`):
    - Move `posX` forward until a 0 bit is found in `binaryX`.
    - Copy the corresponding bit from `binaryN[posN]` into `binaryX[posX]`.
    - Increment both `posX` and `posN` to continue the traversal.
8. Rebuild the final result from the combined binary representation:
    - For each bit i from 0 to 63:
        - If `binaryX[i]` is 1, convert the bit back to its decimal value using `2^i` and add it to `result`.
9. Return `result`, which is the combined binary representation as a decimal number.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(logn)
    - Constructing the binary representation of both x and n-1 involves extracting each bit.
    - The second loop traverses the bits of x to locate the first zero bit and replace it with the corresponding bit from n-1.
    - Converting the modified binary representation back to a decimal requires O(logn) operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(logn)
    - The algorithm utilizes two arrays, `binaryX` and `binaryN`, each with a size of O(logn) to store the bit representations of x and n-1.
    - A constant number of scalar variables (result, bit, `posX`, `posN`) are also used.
