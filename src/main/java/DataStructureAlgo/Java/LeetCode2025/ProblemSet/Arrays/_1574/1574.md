# [1574. Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-to-be-removed-to-make-array-sorted/description)

## Problem Statement
Given an array `arr`, find the length of the shortest subarray that, if removed, makes the resulting array non-decreasing.

## Approach

### Intuition
1. We need to identify the largest prefix and suffix of the array that are non-decreasing.
2. The problem can be solved by combining the prefix and suffix, and finding the minimum subarray length to remove to achieve the desired result.

### Observations
# Three Cases of Array Modification

## Case 1: Array Increases and Then Decreases
If the array is increasing at first and then starts decreasing, all elements after the last increasing element need to be removed.

### Example
Consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` with `n = 9`.
- Here, `l = 4` (index of the last increasing element, value = 5).
- `r = 8` (index of the last element, value = 1).

To make the array non-decreasing, remove all elements after index `4`.
- Elements to remove: `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- Size of the subarray to remove: `4`.
- Calculation: `n - l - 1 = 9 - 4 - 1 = 4`.

## Case 2:  Array Decreases, and Increases Again
When the array has multiple parts where it increases, then decreases, and then increases again, the elements in the middle part need to be removed.

### Example
Consider the array `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` with `n = 10`.
- Here, `l = 0` (index of the first element, value = 5).
- `r = 4` (index of the last element in the decreasing part, value = 1).

To make the array non-decreasing, remove the elements in the middle part.
- Elements to remove: `[5, 4, 3, 2]`.
- Size of the subarray to remove: `4` (or the index `r`).
- otherwise: `n - l - 1 = 10 - 0 - 1 = 9`.

## Case 2: Array Increases, Decreases, increasing, decreasing .... and Increases Again
                                              8/
                                                        7/
                                                       6/
                      4 /              5 / --         5/
                   3 /   L  \3         4/      \3_2_ 4/
                2 /          \ 2 _2__ 3/             R
             1 /
              i                                     j

In such cases, the `i` needs to be merged towards `L` and `r` needs to be merged towards `n` such that `arr[i] <= arr[r]`.
As there could be two cases 
* `arr[l] < arr[r]` then only center part (l..r) needs to remove
* `arr[l] > arr[r]` otherwise some part (i...r) needs to remove 


### Algorithm
1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables**:
    - Use `l` to denote the end of the longest prefix that is non-decreasing.
    - Use `r` to denote the start of the longest suffix that is non-decreasing.
    - Initialize `ans` with the maximum possible length of the subarray to remove, which is `n - 1` where `n` is the length of the array.

2. **Identify the Longest Prefix**:
    - Iterate through the array to find the end of the longest non-decreasing prefix.

3. **Check for Already Sorted Array**:
    - If the entire array is non-decreasing, return `0` since no subarray needs to be removed.

4. **Identify the Longest Suffix**:
    - Iterate from the end of the array to find the start of the longest non-decreasing suffix.

5. **Calculate Initial Answer**:
    - The initial answer can be the minimum length of subarray to remove from either the prefix or the suffix.

6. **Merge the Prefix and Suffix**:
    - Iterate through the array to find the minimum subarray length to remove that combines elements from both the prefix and suffix to form a non-decreasing array.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we only use constant additional space.
