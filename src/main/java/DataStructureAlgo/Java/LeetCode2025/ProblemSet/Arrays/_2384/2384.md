### Intuition and Algorithm for `largestPalindromic`

#### Intuition
The goal is to construct the largest palindromic number possible from the given numeric string.

1. **Frequency Counting**:
    - Count the frequency of each digit (0-9) in the string.
    - Digits with even frequencies can be fully used to form the palindrome.
    - For digits with odd frequencies, we can use the maximum even part and at most one of these digits can be placed in the center of the palindrome.

2. **Forming the Palindrome**:
    - Construct the largest half of the palindrome by placing the digits in descending order (largest to smallest).
    - If thereâ€™s a digit with an odd frequency, place it in the center.
    - Mirror the first half to form the complete palindrome.

#### Algorithm

1. **Frequency Counting**:
    - Initialize an array to count the frequency of each digit.
    - Iterate through the string and populate the frequency array.

2. **Identify Odd Digit and Only-Zero Case**:
    - Identify the largest digit with an odd frequency, if any.
    - Track if the string contains only zeros to handle edge cases.

3. **Constructing the Palindrome**:
    - Construct the first half of the palindrome using digits with even frequencies.
    - Handle zeros carefully to avoid leading zeros in the palindrome.
    - Mirror the first half and add the odd digit in the middle (if any) to form the final palindrome.

4. **Return the Result**:
    - Return the constructed palindromic 

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n) -> For tracing the string one time at start

- Space complexity:
O(1) 


### Example:

**Input:** `num = "098990"`

**Frequency count:**
0: 2 8: 2 9: 2


**Largest odd digit:** None (all digits have even frequency)

**First half:** `98`

**Second half (mirror of the first half):** `89`

**Resulting palindrome:** `98989`

**Output:** `98989`
