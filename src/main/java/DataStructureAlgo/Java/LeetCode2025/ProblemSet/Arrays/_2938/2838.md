# Minimum Steps to Sort Binary String

# Problem
The goal is to sort a binary string such that all `0`s are on the left and all `1`s are on the right. The only allowed operation is swapping adjacent characters. The key observation is that each `0` needs to be swapped with every `1` to its left, and each `1` needs to be swapped with every `0` to its right.

## Intuition
Only opposite numbers can swap, either we choose 0 or 1. Since we need to put 0 on the left and 1 on the right, once we put all 0s on the left, all 1s will automatically be on the right. 
Every 0 needs to be swapped with every 1 on its left side (pushing right 0 to the left). Similarly, every 1 needs to be swapped with every 0 on its right side (pushing left 1 to the right). 
This means that if we run from any one direction (say right), we can find all 0s that need to be pushed to the left, and all 1s that come in between will require a swap per 1 for all zero on right side of it.

Example: `0 1 1 0 1 0`
If we start from the right, we see a `0` that needs to be pushed. Now, all `1s` on the left side of it will require a swap. The more zeros we encounter, the more swaps it requires per `1`. 
The last `0 (5th index)` needs to swap with `1` at `4th, 2nd, 1st index`, which makes `3` swaps. The second last `0 at 3rd index` needs to swap with the `2nd and 1st index`, making a total of `5` swaps.

## Approach
1. **Initialization**: Convert the string to a character array for easy manipulation. Initialize counters for swaps and zeros.
2. **Traverse from Right to Left**: Iterate through the string from the end to the beginning.
    - If a `0` is encountered, increment the zero counter.
    - If a `1` is encountered, add the current count of zeros to the swap counter. This accounts for the swaps needed to move all zeros to the left of this `1`.
3. **Return the Total Swaps**: The total number of swaps required to sort the string.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. This is because we traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we use a constant amount of extra space.

## Example
Consider the string `s = "011010"`.

1. Convert to character array: `['0', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0']`
2. Initialize `swaps = 0` and `zero = 0`.
3. Traverse from right to left:
    - Index 5: `0` -> `zero = 1`
    - Index 4: `1` -> `swaps += zero` -> `swaps = 1`
    - Index 3: `0` -> `zero = 2`
    - Index 2: `1` -> `swaps += zero` -> `swaps = 3`
    - Index 1: `1` -> `swaps += zero` -> `swaps = 5`
    - Index 0: `0` -> `zero = 3`
4. Return `swaps = 5`.

Thus, the minimum number of swaps required to sort the string `011010` is `5`.
