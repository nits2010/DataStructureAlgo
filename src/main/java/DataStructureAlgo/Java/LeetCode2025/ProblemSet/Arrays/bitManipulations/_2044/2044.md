# Counting Maximum OR Subsets
[Leetcode editorial](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-maximum-bitwise-or-subsets/editorial/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-18)
## Intuition - Backtracking
The problem is to find the number of subsets of an array that have the maximum possible bitwise OR value. The bitwise OR of a subset is the result of applying the OR operation to all its elements. The maximum bitwise OR value is the OR of all elements in the array. We need to count how many subsets can achieve this value.

Since we need to know all such subset whose bitwise OR is maxBitWiseOr, we have to try all the subset and check. 
We can take advantage of backtracking to explore all possible subsets of the array. 
For each element, we can decide whether to include it in the current subset or not. 
We can then recursively calculate the count of subsets including the element and excluding the element, and sum these counts.
## Approach
1. **Calculate Maximum Bitwise OR**: First, compute the maximum bitwise OR value of the entire array. This value is the OR of all elements in the array.
2. **Recursive Function**: Use a recursive function to explore all subsets of the array. For each element, decide whether to include it in the current subset or not.
3. **Base Case**: If we have considered all elements, check if the current subset's OR value matches the maximum OR value. If it does, count this subset.
4. **Recursive Case**: For each element, recursively calculate the count of subsets including the element and excluding the element, and sum these counts.

## Example Walkthrough
Consider the array `nums = [3, 1]`.


| Step | i | Current Subset | Current Bitwise OR | Action | Count |
|------|---|----------------|--------------------|--------|-------|
| 1    | 0 | []             | 0                  | Start  |       |
| 2    | 0 | [3]            | 3                  | Include nums[0] |       |
| 3    | 1 | [3, 1]         | 3                  | Include nums[1] |       |
| 4    | 2 | [3, 1]         | 3                  | End of array, max OR matched | 1     |
| 5    | 1 | [3]            | 3                  | Exclude nums[1] |       |
| 6    | 2 | [3]            | 3                  | End of array, max OR matched | 1     |
| 7    | 0 | []             | 0                  | Exclude nums[0] |       |
| 8    | 1 | [1]            | 1                  | Include nums[1] |       |
| 9    | 2 | [1]            | 1                  | End of array, max OR not matched | 0     |
| 10   | 1 | []             | 0                  | Exclude nums[1] |       |
| 11   | 2 | []             | 0                  | End of array, max OR not matched | 0     |

Total count of subsets with maximum OR value = 1 (include both elements) + 1 (include only the first element) = 2



## Intuition - Backtracking + Memoization
We can cache all bitwiseOr we got at all the index, if the same index come again with same bitwiseOr, we can return the value from cache. This will reduce the time complexity of the solution.


## Approach
1. **Calculate Maximum Bitwise OR**: First, compute the maximum bitwise OR value of the entire array. This value is the OR of all elements in the array.
2. **Memoization**: Use a memoization table to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
3. **Recursive Function**: Use a recursive function to explore all subsets of the array. For each element, decide whether to include it in the current subset or not.
4. **Base Case**: If we have considered all elements, check if the current subset's OR value matches the maximum OR value. If it does, count this subset.
5. **Recursive Case**: For each element, recursively calculate the count of subsets including the element and excluding the element, and sum these counts.
