# Longest Square Streak

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-square-streak-in-an-array/solutions/5978309/multiple-solution-sorting-dp-constant-space)

## Intuition-UsingMapSort
The goal is to find the longest streak of numbers in the array where each number is the square of the previous number. 
By sorting the array and using a set to track the numbers, we can efficiently determine the streaks.

## Approach
1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in processing the numbers in ascending order, which simplifies the streak calculation.
2. **Populate the Set**: Add all numbers to a set for O(1) average-time complexity lookups.
3. **Calculate Streaks**:
    - Iterate through each number in the sorted array.
    - For each number, use a helper function `getMaxStreakBS` to calculate the streak starting from that number.
    - Update the maximum streak found.
4. **Helper Function `getMaxStreakBS`**:
    - Initialize the streak count.
    - Continuously check if the current number's square exists in the set.
    - If it does, increment the streak count, remove the number from the set to avoid reprocessing, and update the current number to its square.
    - Return the streak count.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
    - Sorting the array: O(n * log n)
    - Populating the set: O(n)
    - Main loop with `getMaxStreakBS`: O(n) * O(log n) = O(n * log n)
    - Overall: **O(n * log n)**
- **Space Complexity**:
    - The set stores all the numbers: O(n)
    - Additional space for variables and function call stack:  O(1)
    - Overall: ** O(n)**


## Intuition-UsingMapSortBinarySearch
This is similar to above idea, instead of pushing element in set and then remove post finding it, we will use binary search to find the element in the array.
if found, then push in set to avoid reprocessing.


## Intuition-Using Map Without Sort/UsingMapWithoutSortImproved
The one thing is to note here that if the square number exists then its must be in nums only. But finding it takes either `O(n)` or `O(log n)` time. 
Which can be avoided if we use a map to store the numbers. Additionally, it could possible that we have reached same pre-computed element again, in such case, we should not
re-compute its streak, rather utilize the previous computed streak.

## Approach
1. **Initialize Data Structures**:
    - A HashMap `set` to map each number to its index for O(1) average-time complexity lookups.

2. **Populate the HashMap**:
    - Iterate through the `nums` array and populate the `set` with each number and its index/ or its max streak which is `0` initially.

3. **Calculate Streaks**:
    - Iterate through each number in the `nums` array.
    - For each number, calculate the streak starting from that number using a while loop.
    - In the while loop, check if the current number's square exists in the `set`.
    - If it does, increment the streak count, update the current number to its square, and continue.
    - If the current number has already been processed (i.e., its streak is stored in `set`), add that streak to the current streak and break the loop.
    - Update the maximum streak found.

4. **Return the Result**:
    - If the maximum streak is 1, return -1 (indicating no valid streak found).
    - Otherwise, return the maximum streak.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
    - Populating the HashMap: `O(n)`
    - Main loop with while loop: `O(n * O(10^5) = O(n)` the inner loop will execute max 10^5 times.  
    - Overall: **\(O(n \log n)\)**

- **Space Complexity**:
    - Overall: `O(n)`


## Intuition-Optimal Using problem constraints [ Same as above ]
By using boolean arrays to track the existence and visitation of numbers, we can efficiently determine the streaks.

## Approach
1. **Initialize Data Structures**:
    - Two boolean arrays `isExisted` and `isVisited` to track the presence and visitation of numbers up to a maximum value (`max`).

2. **Populate the `isExisted` Array**:
    - Iterate through the `nums` array and mark the presence of each number in the `isExisted` array.

3. **Calculate Streaks**:
    - Iterate through potential starting numbers from 2 up to the square root of `max`.
    - For each number, if it is not present in `nums` or has already been visited, skip it.
    - Mark the number as visited and initialize the streak count.
    - Use a while loop to check if the current number's square exists in the `isExisted` array.
    - If it does, increment the streak count, mark the number as visited, and update the current number to its square.
    - Update the maximum streak found if the current streak is greater than 1.
    - If the current streak equals the length of `nums`, return the length of `nums` as the maximum possible streak.

4. **Return the Result**:
    - If no valid streak is found, return -1.
    - Otherwise, return the maximum streak.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
    - Populating the `isExisted` array: `O(n)`
    - Overall: **\(O(n + sqrt{max}))**

- **Space Complexity**:
    - The boolean arrays `isExisted` and `isVisited`: \(O(max)\)
    - Additional space for variables and function call stack: \(O(1)\)
    - Overall: **\(O(max)\)**
