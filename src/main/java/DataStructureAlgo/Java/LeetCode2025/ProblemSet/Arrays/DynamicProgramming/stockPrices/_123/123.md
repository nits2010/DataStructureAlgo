### Intuition and Approach for `maxProfit`
[Leecode](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/solutions/5913145/simplest-solution-and-explanation-two-scans)
#### Intuition
The goal is to maximize profit with at most two transactions, where you can't hold more than one share at a time. 
The key insight here is to break the problem into two sub-problems: maximizing the profit from two transactions.

Since we need to perform only two transactions without holding two shares at any time, we must sell the earlier share before buying a new one. 
The maximum profit is always generated by selling the earlier share before buying a new one. We know how to solve this problem for one share by tracking the max and profit per element from back to front. 
We can apply the same logic again. After finding the profit from right to left, we can run another transaction from left to right, tracking the minimum value on the left and the profit per element.

The maximum profit will be the maximum value of the sum of profits from both transactions. This is because at each index, the profit from the right and the profit from the left will always be on distinct elements and in different transactions.

1. **First Transaction**:
    - Track the maximum possible profit from the right side (last day to the first day). This gives us the maximum profit that can be achieved from any day up to the current day by considering all prices from the current day to the end.

2. **Second Transaction**:
    - Track the maximum possible profit from the left side (first day to the last day) while also considering the profit from the first transaction. This ensures that at each day, the maximum profit is the sum of the best profit from the right and the current transaction.

#### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
    - Initialize an array `profit` of the same length as `prices` to store the maximum profit up to each day.
    - Track the maximum price encountered from the end of the array to the beginning.

2. **First Transaction** (Right to Left Scan):
    - Traverse the prices array from the end to the beginning.
    - For each day, update the maximum price and calculate the profit if selling on that day.
    - Store the maximum profit up to that day in the `profit` array.

3. **Second Transaction** (Left to Right Scan):
    - Traverse the price array from the beginning to the end.
    - For each day, update the minimum price and calculate the profit if buying on that day.
    - Add the profit from the first transaction (stored in the `profit` array) to the current profit.
    - Update the `profit` array with the maximum profit up to that day.

4. **Return Result**:
    - The last element of the `profit` array contains the maximum possible profit with at most two transactions.

#### Why It Works
- **Two-Pass Strategy**: By using two passes (one from right to left and one from left to right), we efficiently capture the maximum profit from two transactions.
- **Dynamic Tracking**: The `profit` array dynamically tracks the maximum profit achievable up to each day, ensuring we don't miss any potential profit opportunities.
- **Efficient Calculation**: Combining the profits from two transactions in the second pass reduces the need for an additional loop, making the algorithm efficient with a time complexity of O(n).

#### Example Walkthrough
**Input:** `prices = [1, 2, 3, 90, 95, 99, 100]`

1. **Initialization**:
    ```
    n = 7
    profit = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ```

2. **First Transaction (Right to Left)**:
    - Start from the end of the prices array:
      ```
      max = 100
      ```
    - Iterating backwards:
      ```
      i = 5: max = 100, profit = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
      i = 4: max = 100, profit = [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 0]
      i = 3: max = 100, profit = [0, 0, 0, 10, 5, 1, 0]
      i = 2: max = 100, profit = [0, 0, 97, 10, 5, 1, 0]
      i = 1: max = 100, profit = [0, 98, 97, 10, 5, 1, 0]
      i = 0: max = 100, profit = [99, 98, 97, 10, 5, 1, 0]
      ```

3. **Second Transaction (Left to Right)**:
    - Start from the beginning of the prices array:
      ```
      min = 1
      ```
    - Iterating forwards:
      ```
      i = 1: min = 1, profit = [99, 99, 97, 10, 5, 1, 0]
      i = 2: min = 1, profit = [99, 99, 99, 10, 5, 1, 0]
      i = 3: min = 1, profit = [99, 99, 99, 99, 5, 1, 0]
      i = 4: min = 1, profit = [99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 1, 0]
      i = 5: min = 1, profit = [99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 0]
      i = 6: min = 1, profit = [99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99]
      ```

4. **Return Result**:
    - Maximum profit: `99`
