# Intuition, Approach, and Complexity

## Background 
This problem is extension of [300.md](..%2F..%2FbaseProblems%2Fsubsequence%2F_300%2F300.md).
We need to get the LIS / LDS at each index. 


## Intuition

1. **Bi-Directional Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**:
    - Compute the LIS `ending` at each index from the left (increasing subsequence).
    - Compute the LIS `starting` at each index from the right (decreasing subsequence).

2. **Valid Mountain**:
    - For an `index` to be a valid peak of a mountain, it must have both an increasing part before it and a decreasing part after it.
    - Track the maximum length of valid mountains by combining the increasing and decreasing subsequences at each index and subtracting one to avoid double-counting the peak.

3. **Minimum Removals**:
    - The minimum removals needed is the total number of elements minus the maximum length of the valid mountain.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Define two DP arrays: `dpInc` for LIS from the left and `dpDec` for LIS from the right.

2. **Compute LIS**:
    - Populate `dpInc` by iterating forward through the array.
    - Populate `dpDec` by iterating backward through the array.

3. **Find Maximum Mountain**:
    - Iterate through each index to check if it can be a peak (both `dpInc[i] > 1` and `dpDec[i] > 1`).
    - Calculate the combined length of the increasing and decreasing subsequences minus one at each valid peak and track the maximum length.

4. **Calculate Minimum Removals**:
    - Subtract the maximum length of the valid mountain from the total number of elements to get the minimum number of removals.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N^2)` where `N` is the length of the array. This is due to the nested loops for LIS calculation.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N)` for the DP arrays.

## Example Walkthrough

| Step        | Array        | dpInc        | dpDec        | Comments                                    |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Initialization | `[2, 1, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 1]` | `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` | `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` | Initialize DP arrays                           |
| LIS Forward | `[2, 1, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 1]` | `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1]` | `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` | Compute LIS forward                           |
| LIS Backward| `[2, 1, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 1]` | `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1]` | `[1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1]` | Compute LIS backward                          |
| Combine LIS | `[2, 1, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 1]` | `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1]` | `[1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1]` | Find peaks and calculate max mountain length  |
| Result      | `[2, 1, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 1]` | `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1]` | `[1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1]` | Minimum removals = Total elements - max length|

Hope this helps!


## Intuition-BinarySearch
The approach remains the same as previous. The only difference is to use [300.md](..%2F..%2FbaseProblems%2Fsubsequence%2F_300%2F300.md) binary search algorithm for finding LIS. 


## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N * log(N))` where `N` is the length of the array. This is due to the nested loops for LIS calculation.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N)` for the DP arrays.
