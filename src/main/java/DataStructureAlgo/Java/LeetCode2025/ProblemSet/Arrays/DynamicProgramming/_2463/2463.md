[2463. Minimum Total Distance Traveled](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-total-distance-traveled/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-31)
# Intuition, Approach, Complexity, and Example

## Problem Statement

Given a list of robots and their positions, and a 2D array of factories with their positions and limits, determine the minimum total distance that all robots need to travel to be assigned to the factories.
Each factory can fix a certain number of robots.

## Intuition-Recursion
To minimize the total distance traveled by robots assigned to factories, we should aim to pair each robot with a nearby factory. Since we need to assign robots and robots which has the nearest factory will move in the same the direction,
it will be easy to maintain then in one the directions only instead of moving left or right based on distance. Hence, sorting robots will simplify the robot assignment in one direction.
Similarly, since we are assigning robot in one increasing direction, making factories same also simplifies sort factories by their position.

Sorting both robots and factories by position allows us to efficiently match each robot to a close factory.
Once sorted, we can think about assigning robots to factories, but there are many possible combinations. To find the best solution without exploring each possible assignment, 
we can use 0/1 knapsack, starting with the simplest approach: recursion.

Now, we have to assign robots to the nearest factory and additionally since a factory can fix `x` number of robots,
we have to maintain the limit of factories that has been fixed so far, that will make managing them might be difficult.
However, if we say the same thing differently ?? Like, instead of a factory at `i` position has limit=2 we say  At position `i` we have 2factories. 
Then it will become easy as we need to assign a single roboto to a single factory only. Flatten the factory array

We define a recursive function, minDistance(robotIdx, factoryIdx), to calculate the minimum distance possible for assigning robots starting from robotIdx to factories from factoryIdx.
For any robot and factory, there are two choices:
1. Assign the robot to the current factory and proceed to the next robot.
2. Skip the factory and try with the next one.

The base case occurs when we run out of robots, where the distance is zero as all robots have been assigned, or when we run out of factories, where we return a large number (like 1e12) to signify an impossible assignment.

Although this approach is straightforward, it recalculates many of the same assignments repeatedly, especially for similar robot-factory combinations, which introduces unnecessary repetition leading to TLE.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Sort the list of robot positions.
    - Sort the array of factories by their positions.
    - Flatten the factory array into a list where each position appears, according to the factory's limit.

2. **Recursive Function**:
    - Define a recursive function to calculate the minimum total distance by exploring all possible assignments of robots to factories.

3. **Base Cases**:
    - If all robots have been assigned, return 0 (no more distance to cover).
    - If there are no factories left but robots remain, return a large value indicating an invalid assignment.

4. **Choices in Recursive Function**:
    - Assign the current robot to the current factory and move to the next robot and factory.
    - Skip the current factory and try assigning the current robot to the next factory.
    - Return the minimum distance from these two choices.

## Complexity
Let n be the number of robots and m be the number of factories.

### Time complexity: `O(n^2 * m)`

The main function minimumTotalDistance involves sorting the robot array and the factory array. Sorting each of these arrays has a time complexity of `O(n*logn)` and `O(m*logm)`, respectively.
The nested loops that flatten the factory positions contribute an additional `O(k)` for pushing the factory positions into the factoryPositions array. If every factory has a capacity of `k`, 
the overall number of positions pushed could be `O(k⋅m)`. In the worst case, this could lead to `O(n⋅m)` positions if we consider `k` to be on the order of `n`.

The recursive function `minimumTotalDistance` is called for each robot and factory position. This results in up to `O(n⋅k)` recursive calls, where `k` can be up to `n*m` in the extreme case. Thus, the recursive calls lead to
`O(n^2 * m)`


### Space complexity: `O(n+m)`

The space complexity arises from:
1. The recursion stack used in minimumTotalDistance, which can go as deep as `O(n+m)` in the worst case if all robots and factories are utilized.
2. The factoryPositions array, which can store up to `O(k⋅m)` positions, where `k` is the maximum capacity across all factories. However, this is not strictly dependent on `n` or `m`, but it's still reasonable to consider it as contributing to the overall space used.

Therefore, the total space complexity can be considered `O(n+m)` due to the recursive stack and the additional storage used for factoryPositions.


## Intuition-DynamicProgramming-TopDown
This is just an extension of the above, where we use top-down approach to solve this problem. Instead of running the same problem solution again n again, we cache it in memoization.

## Intuition-DynamicProgramming-BottomUp
To solve the problem of assigning robots to factories in a way that minimizes total distance traveled, we can adopt a bottom-up approach. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Robot-Factory Assignment**:
    - For each robot, we have two choices: either assign it to the current factory or don't.
    - We can solve this problem iteratively, avoiding the need to look back.

2. **Defining the Distance Array**:
    - `distance[i][j]` represents the total distance traveled by the robot starting from `i` to the factory starting from `j`.
    - The relation can be defined as:
      ```
      distance[i][j] = Math.min(<assign>, <don't_assign>)
      ```

3. **Assignment Decisions**:
    - If we assign the robot at `i` position to the `j` factory, the travel distance is `abs(robot[i] - factory[j])`. This includes the solution computed with `i+1` and `j+1`.
    - If we don't assign the robot at `i` position to the `j` factory, we continue with the solution previously computed with `i` and `j+1`.
    - The relation updates to:
      ```
      distance[i][j] = Math.min(abs(robot[i] - factory[j]) + distance[i+1][j+1], distance[i][j+1])
      ```

4. **Processing from Lower to Higher**:
   - `distance[i][j]` represents the total distance traveled by the robot starting from 1 robot to `i`th robot to the factory from first factory to `j` th factory.
   - This problem can also be solved from lower to higher indexes as:
     ```
     distance[i][j] = Math.min(abs(robot[i] - factory[j]) + distance[i-1][j-1], distance[i][j-1])
     ```
