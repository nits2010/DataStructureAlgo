# [2275. Largest Combination With Bitwise AND Greater Than Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-combination-with-bitwise-and-greater-than-zero/description)

## Intuition
The goal is to find the maximum number of integers in the array `candidates` that have the same bit set in their binary representation. By counting the number of set bits (1s) at each bit position across all integers, we can determine the bit position with the highest count, which represents the largest combination of integers sharing that bit.

# Brute Force Approach

## Steps
1. Generate all combinations.
2. Start with the largest size combination and get the bitwise AND. If the result is greater than 0, return.

## Observations
1. The largest combination is the given array itself.
2. Bitwise AND will only be 0 if either of the numbers is zero or the bitwise AND of any two or more numbers becomes zero.
3. Bitwise AND of two numbers is zero when the set/unset bit positions of both numbers differ. For example, 'a' has set bits like 101 (5) while 'b' has bits like 010 (2), then 5 & 2 = 0.

## Explanation
Bitwise AND will not be zero if at least one set bit has the same position in both numbers. For example:
- 5 (101)
- 4 (100) both have a set bit at the least significant position.
- 5 & 4 = 100

This implies that all the numbers whose set bit positions are the same can be grouped together.

## Example
Consider the numbers: 16, 17, 71, 62, 12, 24, 14

### Bit Positions
- 16 = 00010000 [4th from left]
- 17 = 00010001 [4th and 8th from left]
- 71 = 01000111 [2nd, 6th, 7th, 8th]
- 62 = 00111110 [3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th]
- 12 = 00001100 [5th, 6th]
- 24 = 00011000 [4th, 5th]
- 14 = 00001110 [5th, 6th, 7th]

### Groupings
- 2nd = 71
- 3rd = 62
- 4th = 16, 17, 62, 24
- 5th = 62, 12, 24, 14
- 6th = 71, 62, 14
- 7th = 71, 62, 14
- 8th = 71

We can see that there are two groups of length 4 having either the 4th or 5th bit set, which will make the bitwise AND of them greater than 0.

Since we are not focused on finding the largest bitwise AND result, either result can be returned.

## Bit Tracking
Now, the problem is how many such bits we need to track.
Since 1 <= candidates[i] <= 10^7 
take log2(x) + 1 = log2(10^7) + 1 = ~24 bits

## Approach
1. **Initialize an array** `setBitCount` of size 24 to zero. This array will store the count of set bits for each bit position from 0 to 23.
2. **Iterate over each bit position** from 0 to 23.
    - For each bit position, iterate over all integers in the `candidates` array.
    - Use a bitwise AND operation to check if the current bit position is set in the integer.
    - If the bit is set, increment the corresponding position in the `setBitCount` array.
3. **Track the maximum count** of set bits across all bit positions.
4. **Return the maximum count** as the result.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * 24)`, where `n` is the number of integers in the `candidates` array. The outer loop runs 24 times (for each bit position), and the inner loop runs \(n\) times (for each integer).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, excluding the input array, as the `setBitCount` array size is constant (24).
