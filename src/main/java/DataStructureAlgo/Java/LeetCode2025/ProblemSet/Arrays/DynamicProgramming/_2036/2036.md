# [2036 - Maximum Alternating Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-alternating-subarray-sum/description/)

# Logical Thinking

We can divide this problem into two dynamic programming sub-problems: Firstly, if we negate the elements with odd indices, 
then the problem becomes to find the maximum subarray sum from 0 to n; Secondly, if we negate the elements with even indices, 
the problem becomes to find the maximum subarray sum from 1 to n. 

For each sub-problem, we can use Kadane's Algorithm to solve it, and the answer is the maximum of two sub-optimum.


# Approach

## Observation

The alternating sum can be split into two patterns based on whether the first element is added (+) or subtracted (-):
1. **Sum1 (Positive Start)**:  
   `nums[i] - nums[i+1] + nums[i+2] - ...`
2. **Sum2 (Negative Start)**:  
   `-nums[i] + nums[i+1] - nums[i+2] + ...`

For each position in the array, we calculate the maximum alternating sum ending at that position for both `Sum1` and `Sum2`.

## Dynamic Programming

We use two variables to keep track of the maximum alternating sum at each position:
- `currentEvenSum`: Maximum alternating sum ending at the current index where the pattern starts with `+`.
- `currentOddSum`: Maximum alternating sum ending at the current index where the pattern starts with `-`.

### Transition
- For `currentEvenSum`:  
  If `nums[i]` is added to the previous pattern, `currentEvenSum` becomes either:
    - `nums[i]` (start a new subarray), or
    - `currentEvenSum + nums[i]`.
- For `currentOddSum`:  
  If `nums[i]` is subtracted, calculate `currentOddSum` similarly, taking into account the alternate pattern.

At each step, update the global maximum answer.

## Time Complexity

- The solution only requires a single traversal of the array, so the **time complexity** is **O(n)**.
- The **space complexity** is **O(1)** because we use only a few variables.
