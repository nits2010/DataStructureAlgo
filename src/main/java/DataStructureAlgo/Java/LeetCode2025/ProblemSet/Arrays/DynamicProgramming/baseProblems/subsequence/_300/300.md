# Intuition, Thought Process, and Approach

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). 
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Intuition

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: Use a DP array where `lis[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends at index `i`.
2. **State Transition**: To determine `lis[i]`, we need to consider all indices `j` that are less than `i` (`j < i`). 
3. If `nums[j] < nums[i]`, then `lis[i]` can be updated as the maximum of its current value and `1 + lis[j]`.

## Thought Process

1. **Initialization**:
    - Define a DP array `lis` with the same length as the input array.
    - Initialize `lis[0]` to 1, since the LIS ending at the first element is just the element itself.

2. **DP Transition**:
    - Iterate over the array starting from the second element.
    - For each element at index `i`, iterate over all previous elements (indices `j` where `j < i`).
    - If `nums[i] > nums[j]`, update `lis[i]` to be the maximum of `lis[i]` and `1 + lis[j]`.
    - Keep track of the maximum value in the `lis` array to get the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

3. **Edge Case**:
    - Handle arrays with length 0 or 1 separately, returning the length of the array as the LIS.

## Approach

1. **Initialize DP Array**:
    - Set `lis[0]` to 1.
    - Iterate over the array to fill the `lis` array based on the DP transition formula.

2. **Update DP Array**:
    - For each index `i`, check all previous indices `j` and update `lis[i]` if `nums[i] > nums[j]`.
    - Track the maximum length of LIS during this process.

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(n)


## Intuition-Binary Search

1. **Binary Search with Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: Utilize a DP array to keep track of the smallest ending element of each increasing subsequence length encountered so far.
2. **Optimal Substructure**: Use binary search to efficiently find the position to replace elements in the DP array, ensuring the array remains sorted and the LIS is correctly extended or updated.

## Thought Process

1. **Initialization**:
    - Define a DP array `lis` to store the smallest ending element for each length of increasing subsequence.
    - Initialize `lisLength` to track the current length of the LIS.

2. **Traverse the Array**:
    - Start by initializing the first element of the DP array `lis` with the first element of the input array.
    - Iterate through the input array starting from the second element.

3. **Binary Search for Insertion Point**:
    - For each element in the array, use binary search to find the appropriate position in the DP array to either replace an existing element or extend the LIS.
    - If the current element is smaller than the first element of the DP array, replace the first element.
    - If the current element is larger than the last element of the DP array, extend the LIS by appending this element.
    - Otherwise, use binary search to find the appropriate position to replace an element in the DP array, maintaining the smallest possible ending element for the subsequence.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Initialize `lisLength` to 1, as the first element forms an increasing subsequence of length 1.
    - Initialize `lis[0]` with the first element of the input array.

2. **Iterate and Update**:
    - For each element, use binary search to find its position in the `lis` array.
    - Update `lis` and `lisLength`
