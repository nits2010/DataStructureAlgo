# [1975. Maximum Matrix Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matrix-sum/description)

## Intuition

The task is to find the maximum sum of a matrix after optionally flipping the signs of some of its elements.

To maximize the matrix sum, let’s first imagine the ideal situation: if every element in the matrix were positive, we
would have the highest possible sum. Since we can flip pairs of adjacent elements by multiplying them by -1, we could,
in theory, make all values positive if we wanted. So, we start by calculating the sum of the absolute values of all
elements, as this would be the ideal maximum sum if all elements were positive.

Next, we need to think about when flipping doesn’t work perfectly. Specifically, if there’s an odd number of negative
elements, it won’t be possible to make everything positive because one negative will always remain. This observation
leads us to a simple rule: if there’s an even count of negative numbers, we can flip them all to positive values. But if
the count is odd, one number has to stay negative, which means the sum can’t be quite as high as in the ideal case.

To minimize the impact of this remaining negative, we want it to be the smallest number in the matrix. So, while
calculating the absolute sum, we also track the smallest absolute value. This way, if we end up with an odd count of
negatives, we can subtract twice this smallest value from the total. This subtraction accounts for the one unavoidable
negative element and keeps the final sum as high as possible.

## Why subtract twice the smallest absolute value?

For an odd count of negative numbers, flipping a negative number to positive adds that number's absolute value to the
total sum. For example, if we had flipped `-1` to `+1`, it would increase the sum by `+1`. However, since we can't flip
this number (due to the odd count of negatives), we need to "remove" this potential gain. This is why we subtract twice
the smallest absolute value: once to account for the gain we didn’t get and again because we didn’t flip it.

## Example

Consider the matrix:

## Approach

1. **Initialize Variables**:
    - `sum` to store the total sum of the matrix elements after converting all elements to their absolute values.
    - `smallest` to store the smallest absolute value found in the matrix.
    - `negCount` to count the number of negative elements in the matrix.

2. **Iterate Through the Matrix**:
    - For each element in the matrix, check if it is negative. If it is, increment `negCount` and convert the element to
      its absolute value.
    - Add the absolute value of the element to `sum`.
    - Update `smallest` to be the minimum of the current smallest value and the current element.

3. **Adjust Sum for Odd Number of Negatives**:
    - If `negCount` is odd, subtract twice the smallest value from `sum`. This accounts for flipping the smallest
      absolute value to ensure the sum is maximized.

4. **Return the Result**:
    - Return the computed `sum`

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n*m)`, where `n * m` is the number of elements in the matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we only use a constant amount of space.
