# Finding the Kth Bit in a Binary Sequence

## Intuition
[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-kth-bit-in-nth-binary-string/solutions/5938183/simplest-and-detailed-explanation-recursive-solution)
The code provided is a recursive function designed to find the Kth bit of a specific binary string derived from a sequence of transformations. The sequence is constructed based on the following rules:

1. The first string is "0."
2. Each later string is formed by taking the previous string, appending a "1," and then appending the reverse of the inverted (flipped) version of the previous string.

For example, the first few strings in the sequence are:

- `S1 = "0"`
- `S2 = "011"`
- `S3 = "0111001"`
- `S4 = "011100110110001"`

Now, lets analysis the output string to get the pattern, if any exists. 
Following basic observation which can be made
1. The First character of the string is always being `0`
2. The middle character of the final string is always `1`
3. Post the middle character, the second half of the string is the same as the first half of the reversed inverted string. 

Now, let's try to find the final string length since we need to find the `k`th bit in it. 


- `S1 = "0"` L(1) = 1, TL = 1 -> `[1]`
- `S2 = "0 | 1 | 1"` L(1) = L(2) = 1 TL = 3 -> `[2^2 - 1]`
- `S3 = "011 | 1 | 001"` L(1) = L(2)  = 3 TL = 7 -> `[2^3 - 1]`
- `S4 = "0111001 | 1 | 0110001"`  L(1) = L(2) = 7 TL = 15 -> `[2^4 - 1]`


Here `|` denotes the first half, middle and the second half. `L(1)` denotes the length of the first half, `L(2)` denotes the length of the second half. The length of the first and second half is always the same. 
TL denotes the total length which is `2*L(1) + 1`. Which has the pattern `2^n - 1`. Which makes the length of first half pattern as `(2^n - 1) / 2` = `((2^n-1) - 1)` [ center bit adjusted ]. 

Now, 
1. if `k` = 1 then output is `0`. 
2. if `k` = TL / 2 then output is `1`.
3. if `k > TL / 2` then `k` bit belongs to second part, which is nothing but flipped of the `TL - k`th bit in first part. Please not, we did not add `1` in this transition  as `TL - k + 1` because `k`th bit is `1-indexed`. 
4. if `k < TL / 2` then `k` bit belongs to first part.



The recursive nature of the function leverages the structure of the strings to efficiently determine the Kth bit without generating the entire sequence.

## Approach

1. **Base Case**:
    - If `k == 1` or `n == 1`, return `'0'`. This is because the first bit of any string `S(n)` for `n=1` is always `'0'`.

2. **Calculate Length**:
    - The length of the binary string `S(n)` is `2^n - 1`. This can be computed as `1 << n`. We did not did `-1` because we need  `1-indexed` bit. 

3. **Determine Position**:
    - If `k` is less than half of the length (`length / 2`), the Kth bit is in the first half of the string, so the function recursively calls itself with `n - 1` and `k`.
    - If `k` equals half of the length, return `'1'`, as this bit corresponds to the transition point between the first half and the inverted second half.
    - If `k` is greater than half the length, the Kth bit is in the second half. In this case:
        - The corresponding bit in the first half can be found by computing `length - k`.
        - The function then recursively finds this bit and inverts it (changing `'0'` to `'1'` and vice versa) before returning it.

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n) - where `n` is the length of the string `S(n)`.

### Space Complexity
- Space Complexity: O(n) - where `n` is the length of the string `S(n)`.

## Final Result
The Kth bit for `n = 4` and `k = 11` is: **'1'**
