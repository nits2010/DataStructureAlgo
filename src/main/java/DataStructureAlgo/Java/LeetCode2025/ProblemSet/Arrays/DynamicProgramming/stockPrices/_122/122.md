//this algorithm won't fail, consider below case
//prices [1,2,3,90,95,99,100] max profit : (2-1) + (3-2) + (90-3) + (95-90) + (99-95)+ (100-99) = 1 + 1 + 87 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 99
// it is no advantage to hold the minimum value share `1` and sell at the end `100` makes profit 99 <= 99


### Intuition and Approach for `maxProfit`

#### Intuition
The goal is to maximize profit from stock prices where multiple transactions are allowed, 
but you cannot hold more than one share at a time. 
To achieve the maximum profit, we can sell the stock whenever we see a profit, as selling early provides the opportunity to buy again and 
potentially sell at a higher price later. This approach uses a greedy strategy, always opting to take the immediate profit rather than holding out for a potentially larger profit that may or may not occur.

Consider the example: 
`prices = [1, 2, 3, 90, 95, 99, 100]`
Here, selling at all profitable opportunity yields:
`(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) + (90 - 3) + (95 - 90) + (99 - 95) + (100 - 99) = 1 + 1 + 87 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 99`

Comparing this to holding the stock from the lowest price to the highest price:
`100 - 1 = 99`

This confirms that our greedy approach doesn't miss out on profit.

#### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
    - Initialize a variable `profit` to store the accumulated profit.

2. **Iterate Through Prices**:
    - Loop through the array of prices starting from the second element.
    - For each price, check if it is higher than the previous day's price:
        - If it is, calculate the profit from buying at the previous day's price and selling at the current price.
        - Add this profit to the total `profit`.

3. **Return Result**:
    - Return the accumulated `profit`.

This approach efficiently captures all potential profit opportunities through a single pass over the prices array.
