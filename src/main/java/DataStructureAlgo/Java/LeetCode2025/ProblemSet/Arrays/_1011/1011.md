# Ship Within Days

## Intuition
The problem is to find the minimum capacity of a ship to ship all packages within a given number of days.

To find the least ship capacity, we first need to determine the ship's maximum capacity. How do we find the maximum capacity? It's straightforward: if we assume the ship can carry every package at once, the total weight it carries would be the maximum capacity (sum of all weights).

But how do we find the least capacity from the maximum capacity? On the other hand, we can also assume that our ship can't carry anything, making its minimum capacity zero (0) or the least weight from the cargo.

That's progress! We know the minimum capacity (0 or least weight) and the maximum capacity (sum of weights). But how do we determine the least capacity to carry items in D days?

The key factor here is the number of days, D. Let's suppose we propose a certain capacity for the ship and ask someone to check if the ship can carry all the weights within its capacity and the given days. If they confirm it can, then this proposed capacity is a potential answer. However, since we need the least capacity, we try to reduce it further.

Do you see a pattern? Yes, it's binary search!

- `low` = least weight
- `high` = Sum(weights[0...n-1])
- `mid` = proposed capacity

The important part is implementing this check. We can simply assign weights one by one and check if the ship can carry all the weights in D days or not. If it can, we reduce the search space to (low, mid-1) since mid was a potential solutionUsingMapWithoutSort. Otherwise, we increase the capacity to (mid+1, high).

### Require Days
We will write a helper function, which will tell us how many days it would require to ship all packages with a given capacity. If the required days are less than the given days, then we will reduce the upper bound. Otherwise, we will increase the lower bound. However, if we can ship all the items exactly in the given days with the given capacity, then it's our potential candidate. The further process is to reduce it further from the same space.

#### How do we find required days?
Well, given a capacity, we can continuously sum the weights until it exceeds the given capacity. Once it exceeds, that means we need one more day to ship.

## Approach
1. **Initialize the Search Range**:
    - `low` is set to the maximum weight of a single package.
    - `high` is set to the sum of all package weights.

2. **Binary Search**:
    - Calculate the middle point `capacity` of the current range.
    - Determine the number of days required to ship all packages with this `capacity` using the `requireDays` function.
    - Adjust the search range based on the number of days required:
        - If the required days are less than or equal to the given days, reduce the upper bound (`high`).
        - Otherwise, increase the lower bound (`low`).

3. **Return the Result**:
    - The minimum capacity that allows shipping within the given days is found when `low` equals `high`.
