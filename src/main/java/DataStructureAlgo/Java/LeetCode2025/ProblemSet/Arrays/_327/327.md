# Count Range Sum using Prefix Sum and Merge Sort

## ✅ Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of range sums that lie in `[lower, upper]` inclusive.
A range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between indices `i` and `j` (i ≤ j), inclusive.

## 🔁 Naive and Optimized Approaches

### 🔹 Naive Approach (O(n³))

- Since we need to find all such subarrays whose sum lies in `[lower, upper]`, we can consider all possible subarrays `O(n²)`.
- For each subarray, sum its elements in `O(n)` and check if the sum lies in range.
- Total complexity: `O(n³)`.

### 🔹 Brute Force Using Prefix Sum (O(n²))

- Improve the naive solution using prefix sums to get `sum(i,j) = prefix[j] - prefix[i]` in `O(1)`.
- Time Complexity:
    - `O(n)` to build prefix sum.
    - `O(n²)` to iterate through all subarrays and compute range sums in constant time.

### 🔹 Divide & Conquer Using Merge Sort (O(n log n))

- With prefix sum array, we reduce the problem to counting how many `prefix[i]` values lie in the range:

```
* lower <= prefixSum(j) - prefixSum(i) <= upper { subtract prefixSum(j) }
      lower - prefixSum(j) <= -prefixSum(i) <= upper - prefixSum(j) {now negate the equation since currently its -prefixSum(i)}
      -lower + prefixSum(j) >= prefixSum(i) >= -upper + prefixSum(j)
      =>          prefixSum(j) - upper <= prefixSum(i) <= prefixSum(j) - lower
      Hence,      prefixSum(i) should be in the range of [prefixSum(j) - upper , prefixSum(j) - lower]
```

- So for each `j`, we need to count number of `i < j` where `prefix[i]` lies in the above range.
- We need to find all, prefixSum(i) which lies in range `[prefixSum(j) - upper , prefixSum(j) - lower]`

### 🔍 Range Count Rewrite

```
lower ≤ prefix[j] - prefix[i] ≤ upper
→ prefix[j] - upper ≤ prefix[i] ≤ prefix[j] - lower
```

We isolate the target range for `prefix[i]` and count how many values fall into it.

- We define two pointers:
    - `k`: first index such that `prefix[k] - prefix[i] >= lower`
    - `j`: first index such that `prefix[j] - prefix[i] > upper`
```
        prefixSum(i) - prefixSum(j1) <= -lower
    =>    prefixSum(j1) - prefixSum(i) >= lower
     
        prefixSum(i) >= prefixSum(j2) - upper  
    =>    prefixSum(j2) - prefixSum(1) <= upper
```

Thus `count += (j - k)`.

### 🧠 Why Merge Sort

- Merge sort ensures the left and right halves of prefix sums remain sorted.
- While merging, we count how many values from left half fall within the range `[prefix[j] - upper, prefix[j] - lower]`.

## 📈 Time and Space Complexity

- Time: `O(n log n)` — from merge sort
- Space: `O(n)` — extra space for prefix sums and merging

---

## 🔍 Why `prefix[0] = 0`?

- Ensures we can handle subarrays starting at index 0.
- Makes prefix difference logic work uniformly for all ranges.

---

## ✅ Summary

- Use prefix sums to convert range sum into prefix difference.
- Use modified merge sort to count ranges in `O(n log n)`.
