 * Question Category: 2064. Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store
 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimized-maximum-of-products-distributed-to-any-store/description/
 * You are given an integer n indicating there are n specialty retail stores. There are m product types of varying amounts, which are given as a 0-indexed integer array quantities, where quantities[i] represents the number of products of the ith product type.
 * <p>
 * You need to distribute all products to the retail stores following these rules:
 * <p>
 * A store can only be given at most one product type but can be given any amount of it.
 * After distribution, each store will have been given some number of products (possibly 0). Let x represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You want x to be as small as possible, i.e., you want to minimize the maximum number of products that are given to any store.
 * Return the minimum possible x.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: n = 6, quantities = [11,6]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: One optimal way is:
 * - The 11 products of type 0 are distributed to the first four stores in these amounts: 2, 3, 3, 3
 * - The 6 products of type 1 are distributed to the other two stores in these amounts: 3, 3
 * The maximum number of products given to any store is max(2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) = 3.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: n = 7, quantities = [15,10,10]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: One optimal way is:
 * - The 15 products of type 0 are distributed to the first three stores in these amounts: 5, 5, 5
 * - The 10 products of type 1 are distributed to the next two stores in these amounts: 5, 5
 * - The 10 products of type 2 are distributed to the last two stores in these amounts: 5, 5
 * The maximum number of products given to any store is max(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5) = 5.
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: n = 1, quantities = [100000]
 * Output: 100000
 * Explanation: The only optimal way is:
 * - The 100000 products of type 0 are distributed to the only store.
 * The maximum number of products given to any store is max(100000) = 100000.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * m == quantities.length
 * 1 <= m <= n <= 105
 * 1 <= quantities[i] <= 105
