### Intuition, Approach, Complexity, and Example Walkthrough for `maxProfit`

#### Intuition
The problem requires maximizing profit with at most `k` transactions, where a transaction consists of buying and then selling a stock. To solve this, we break down the problem into sub-problems using dynamic programming. The key idea is to keep track of the maximum profit on each day for each transaction.

Just like the problem we solved for two transactions [123.md](..%2F_123%2F123.md), we can apply a similar logic here. For two transactions, we perform the first transaction from right to left and get the profit from that. Then, we perform the second transaction from left to right and add the profit from this transaction to the profit of the last transaction. Similarly, for any transaction on the `i`th day, we first calculate the profit on the `i-1`th day with `k` transactions. To find the profit by doing `k` transactions, we need to know the profit by `k-1` transactions on the same day. Just like the profit on the 2nd transaction requires the profit from the 1st transaction.

#### Approach
`Profit[k][i]` represents the profit on the `i`th day with `k` transactions.

- `Profit[k][i] = Max(<not doing any transaction on `i` day>, <doing any transaction on `i` day>)`
    - `Profit[k][i-1]` represents not doing any transaction on the `i`th day and taking the profit of the previous day.
    - To get the profit by doing any transaction on the `i`th day, we need to buy it on any one of `[0, i-1] -> j` days such that `prices[i] > prices[j]`. We also need to know the profit of the `j`th day with `k-1` transactions.
    - Hence, `Max(profit[k-1][j] - prices[j] + prices[i])` will be the profit on the `i`th day with `k` transactions.
- Therefore, `Profit[k][i] = Max(Profit[k][i-1], Max(profit[k-1][j] - prices[j] + prices[i]))` for all `j` in the range `[0, i-1]`.

Here, `Max(profit[k-1][j] - prices[j] + prices[i])` for all `j` in the range `[0, i-1]`, we can see that `prices[i]` is constant in all previous `j` days. So this can be written as `Max(profit[k-1][j] - prices[j]) + prices[i]` for all `j` in the range `[0, i-1]`, which implies finding the max profit on the `j`th day with `k-1` transactions, where `j` is in the range `[0, i-1]`.

`Max(profit[k-1][j] - prices[j])` can be continuously calculated while calculating the profit on the `i`th day with `k` transactions.

Hence, `Profit[k][i] = Max(Profit[k][i-1], prevMax + prices[i])` where `prevMax = Max(profit[k-1][j] - prices[j])` for `j` in the range `[0, i-1]`.

Since at a time, we've been using only last transactions data, hence we can further optimize the space by using only two rows.

`profit[1][i] = Max ( profit[1][i-1], max ( profit[0][j] - prices[j] ) + prices[i] )`


#### Approach
1. **Initialize Profit Matrix**:
    - Use a 2D array `profit` to keep track of maximum profit for each day and each transaction.
    - Optimize space by using only two rows, since we only need information from the current and previous transactions.

2. **Handle Maximum Transactions**:
    - If `k >= n/2` (where `n` is the length of prices),
    - To make a profit, we need to both buy and sell a share, meaning that each transaction requires two days. Now, 
    - if we assume we buy on the 1st day and sell on the 2nd day, then buy on the 3rd day and sell on the 4th day, and so on, 
    - the maximum number of transactions we can perform is `n/2`. 
    - Therefore, if `k >= n/2`, we can execute at most `n/2` transactions.


3. **Dynamic Programming**:
    - Iterate over the number of transactions.
    - For each transaction, track the maximum profit from previous transactions with a variable `prevMax`.
    - Iterate over the days, updating the maximum profit for each day based on two choices:
        - Not performing a transaction on the current day, taking the previous day's profit.
        - Performing a transaction, buying at an earlier day, and selling on the current day.
    - Copy the current transaction profits to the previous transaction for the next iteration.

4. **Return Result**:
    - The maximum profit after the last transaction on the last day is the result.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(k * n), where `k` is the number of transactions and `n` is the number of days. This is because we have a nested loop iterating through transactions and days.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), since we use a 2D array with only two rows to store the profits.
