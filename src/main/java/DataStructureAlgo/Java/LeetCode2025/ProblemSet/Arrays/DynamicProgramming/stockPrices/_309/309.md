## Problem Statement

Given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the i-th day, you need to find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:
- You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).


### Intuition

1. **Transaction State Management**:
    - We need to manage the states of buying and selling over the given days.
    - Use recursion to explore the possibilities of either buying, selling, or taking a cooldown on any given day.

2. **Two Choices**:
    - On any given day, we can either:
        1. Buy the stock and move to the next day.
        2. Do nothing (cool down).
    - If it's a selling day, we can either:
        1. Sell the stock and cool down the next day.
        2. Do nothing (cool down).

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Define constants for buying and selling states.
    - Start recursion from the first day with the buying state.

2. **Recursive Function**:
    - If the current-day index exceeds the length of prices, return 0 (base case).
    - If it's a buying day:
        - Calculate profit by either buying the stock and moving to the next day with the selling state or skipping the buy and moving to the next day with the buying state(cooldown).
    - If it's a selling day:
        - Calculate profit by either selling the stock and moving two days ahead with the buying state (cooldown one day) or skipping the sell and moving to the next day with the selling state.
    - Return the maximum profit obtained.

#### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: Exponential in the worst case due to the recursive calls, `O(2^n)`, where `n` is the number of days.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` due to the recursion stack.

| Step           | Day  | State    | Action                     | Profit Calculation | Comments                                       |
|----------------|------|----------|----------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Initialization | 0    | Buying   | Start recursion            | -                  | Initialize with buying state                   |
| Day 0          | 0    | Buying   | Max(buying, cooldown)      | -prices[0] or 0    | Decide to buy at day 0 or cooldown             |
| Day 1          | 1    | Selling  | Max(selling, cooldown)     | prices[1] or 0     | Decide to sell at day 1 or cooldown            |
| Day 2          | 2    | Buying   | Max(buying, cooldown)      | -prices[2] or 0    | Repeat the process                             |
| ...            | ...  | ...      | ...                        | ...                | Continue until all days are processed          |


## Intuition-DynamicProgramming

### Intuition-Top-Down-Approach
This is an extension of the above, since there are many sub-problems; we can simply cache them. 
There are `n` days and have two states: `buying` and `selling`. Hence, our cache will be 
```
Integer[][] dp = new Integer[n][2]; // n days, with two possibilities buy or sell
```

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Define constants for buying and selling states.
    - Initialize a 2D DP array `dp` to store results of subproblems.
    - Start recursion from the first day with the buying state.

2. **Recursive Function with Memoization**:
    - If the current-day index exceeds the length of prices, return 0 (base case).
    - If the result is already computed for the current state, return it.
    - If it's a buying day:
        - Calculate profit by either buying the stock and moving to the next day with the selling state, or skipping the buy and moving to the next day with the buying state.
    - If it's a selling day:
        - Calculate profit by either selling the stock and moving two days ahead with the buying state (cooldown one day), or skipping the sell and moving to the next day with the selling state.
    - Store and return the maximum profit

#### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: Exponential in the worst case due to the recursive calls, `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of days.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` due to the recursion stack.


### Intuition-Bottom-Up-Approach
Similarly to top-down, this simply can be converted to bottom up. 

`dp[i][1]` defines the profit gained by buying on day i
`dp[i][0]` defines the profit gained by selling on day i
With that, we can define dp[i][0|1]
```
dp[i][buy] = Math.max (
                      Max ( <buy on ith day, sell on i+1 day> - prices[i] , cool-down on i+1 day> ),
                      Max ( <sell on ith day and do cool down on i+1 day> + prices[i], <cool-down on i+1 day> )`
```

```
dp[i][buy] = Math.max ( Math.max(dp[i+1][0] - prices[i], dp[i+1][1]), Math.max( dp[i+2][1] + prices[i], dp[i+1][0] ) )`

```

since cool-down is common, we can extract it

```
dp[i][buy] = Max ( Max(dp[i+1][0] - prices[i] , dp[i+2][1] + prices[i]), dp[i+1][0] )`
```

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Define a 2D DP array `dp` with dimensions `[n+2][2]` to store results of subproblems, where `n` is the length of the prices array.
    - Start filling the DP array from the last day to the first day, considering both buying and selling states.

2. **DP Transition**:
    - For each day from the last to the first:
        - If the state is buying (`buy == 1`):
            - Calculate the maximum profit by either buying the stock on the current day or skipping the buy.
        - If the state is selling (`buy == 0`):
            - Calculate the maximum profit by either selling the stock on the current day or skipping the sell.
    - Extract the common part of the DP transition to simplify the formula.

3. **Result**:
    - The result is the maximum profit on the first day with the buying state.

#### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of days, due to the single pass through the DP array.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, for the DP array used to store 

### Intuition-Bottom-Up-Approach - Optimized
For all the days, we have only two states to consider: `buying` and `selling`. Hence, we can simply calculate them, removing the need of inner loop. 

```
 for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                    dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][0] - prices[i], dp[i + 1][1]);
                    dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i + 2][1] + prices[i], dp[i + 1][0]);
                }
                return dp[0][1];
```

#### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of days, due to the single pass through the DP array.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, for the DP array used to store 

### Intuition-Bottom-Up-Approach - Space Optimized
We are using only `i+1` and `i+2` and the current `i`, hence only `3` layers are being used.
Every day post-transaction, `i+2` will be gone, `i+1` become `i+2` day, and current `i` will be `i+1` day

```

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                    dp[0][1] = Math.max(dp[1][0] - prices[i], dp[1][1]);
                    dp[0][0] = Math.max(dp[2][1] + prices[i], dp[1][0]);

                    //1 -> 2,
                    dp[2][1] = dp[1][1];
                    dp[2][0] = dp[1][0];

                    // 0 -> 1
                    dp[1][0] = dp[0][0];
                    dp[1][1] = dp[0][1];

                }
                return dp[0][1];
```
#### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of days, due to the single pass through the DP array.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, for the DP array used to store
