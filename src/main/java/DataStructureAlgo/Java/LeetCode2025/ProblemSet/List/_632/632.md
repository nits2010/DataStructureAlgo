## Intuition - MinHeap
The goal is to find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists of sorted integers. 
The challenge is to efficiently track and compare elements from multiple lists simultaneously.

#### How We Came Up With This Solution
We need to find the minimum and maximum values from all lists such a way that making range of it contains at least 1 value from 
all the list. Choosing minimum amoung make sure the lower bound and choose maximum value among the list make sure the upper bound accross list. 
To choose the minimum value, we can sort the minimum values of all lists or use min-heap. 

1. **Tracking Minimum and Maximum Elements**:
    - Use a min-heap to keep track of the current smallest elements from each list. This helps in identifying the smallest element to potentially include in the range.
    - Maintain a variable to track the maximum element encountered so far. This ensures the range always includes elements from all lists.

2. **Efficient Range Comparison**:
    - Continuously update the range by comparing the current minimum and maximum elements.
    - Use a helper function to compare and update the range based on the smallest possible range definition.

3. **Managing List Elements**:
    - Add the smallest element from each list to the min-heap initially.
    - Replace the smallest element from the heap with the next element from the same list, updating the maximum value if necessary.
    - If a list is exhausted, break the loop as it signifies all elements from the list are processed, ensuring the smallest range is found.

#### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
    - If the input list `nums` is null or empty, return an array with `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
    - Use a `PriorityQueue` (min-heap) to store elements as triplets containing the element value, its index in the list, and the list index.
    - Initialize `maxValue` to track the highest value encountered so far.

2. **Insert Smallest Elements**:
    - Add the first element from each list to the min-heap and update `maxValue`.

3. **Processing Elements**:
    - Continuously extract the smallest element from the heap.
    - Compare and update the range using the smallest element and `maxValue`.
    - Add the next element from the extracted element's list to the heap.
    - Update `maxValue` if the new element is larger.

4. **Return Result**:
    - Return the smallest range found.

#### Why We Use a Min-Heap
- **Efficient Access**: Using a min-heap allows us to efficiently access and remove the smallest element among the lists. This is crucial for dynamically adjusting the current range.
- **Dynamic Updates**: As new elements are added, the min-heap maintains the order, ensuring that the smallest element is always at the top.
- **Time Complexity**: Operations on the heap (insertions and deletions) are O(log k), making the approach efficient given that k lists are 


# Complexity Analysis
Let n be the total number of elements across all lists and k be the number of lists.

### Time complexity: O(nlogk)

The initial loop that inserts the first element from each list into the priority queue runs in O(k). 
The while loop continues until we have exhausted one of the lists in the priority queue. 
Each iteration of the loop involves:

Extracting the minimum element from the priority queue, which takes O(logk).
Inserting a new element from the same list into the priority queue, which also takes O(logk).
In the worst case, we will process all n elements, leading to a total complexity of O(nlogk).

### Space complexity: O(k)

The priority queue can hold at most k elements at any time, corresponding to the first elements of each of the k lists. 
Thus, the space complexity is O(k). Additionally, the space for storing the output range (two integers) is negligible and does not contribute to the overall complexity.


## Intuition - Two Pointers
This solution is inspired by [76.md](..%2F..%2FStrings%2F_76%2F76.md)
The goal is to find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists of sorted integers. 
By merging these lists into one sorted list, we can then use a sliding window to efficiently determine the smallest range that includes elements 
from all lists.

#### How We Came Up With This Solution
1. **Merging Lists**:
   - Merge all the k lists into a single list while keeping track of which element came from which list. 
   - This allows us to handle elements from different lists simultaneously in a sorted order.

2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Use a sliding window to maintain a range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists. As the window expands and contracts, keep track of the range that includes elements from all lists.

3. **Tracking List Coverage**:
   - Use a frequency map to track how many elements from each list are included in the current window. This helps in determining when a valid range that includes all lists is found.

#### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - If the input list `nums` is null or empty, return an array with `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
   - Create a merged list of all elements from the k lists, each paired with its originating list index.
   - Sort the merged list by elements.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Initialize two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the window's boundaries.
   - Use a frequency map (`kListFreq`) to track the count of elements from each list within the window.
   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer, and update the frequency map.
   - If all lists are included in the window, update the range if the current range is smaller.
   - Shrink the window by moving the `left` pointer, ensuring the window still includes elements from all lists.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the smallest range found.

#### Why It Works
- **Sorted Merged List**: By merging and sorting the lists, we can handle elements from different lists in a single pass.
- **Sliding Window**: The sliding window allows for efficient expansion and contraction, ensuring that the smallest possible range is found.
- **Frequency Map**: The map ensures that the range always includes elements from all k lists, maintaining the problem's constraints.

#### Example Walkthrough
**Input:**
`nums = [ [4, 10, 15, 24, 26], [0, 9, 12, 20], [5, 18, 22, 30] ]`

1. **Merging Lists**:
    ```
    mergedList = [
        (4, 0), (10, 0), (15, 0), (24, 0), (26, 0),
        (0, 1), (9, 1), (12, 1), (20, 1),
        (5, 2), (18, 2), (22, 2), (30, 2)
    ]
    sortedMergedList = [
        (0, 1), (4, 0), (5, 2), (9, 1), (10, 0),
        (12, 1), (15, 0), (18, 2), (20, 1), (22, 2),
        (24, 0), (26, 0), (30, 2)
    ]
    ```

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Initialize:
       ```
       left = 0, right = 0
       kListFreq = {}
       hasIncluded = 0
       range = [0, Integer.MAX_VALUE]
       ```

   - Expand window and update range:
       ```
       right = 0: (0, 1) -> kListFreq = {1: 1}, hasIncluded = 1
       right = 1: (4, 0) -> kListFreq = {1: 1, 0: 1}, hasIncluded = 2
       right = 2: (5, 2) -> kListFreq = {1: 1, 0: 1, 2: 1}, hasIncluded = 3
       range = [0, 5]

       Shrink window:
       left = 0 -> kListFreq = {1: 0, 0: 1, 2: 1}, hasIncluded = 2
       ```

   - Continue expanding and updating:
       ```
       right = 3: (9, 1) -> kListFreq = {1: 1, 0: 1, 2: 1}, hasIncluded = 3
       range = [4, 9]

       Shrink window:
       left = 1 -> kListFreq = {1: 1, 0: 0, 2: 1}, hasIncluded = 2

       right = 4: (10, 0) -> kListFreq = {1: 1, 0: 1, 2: 1}, hasIncluded = 3
       range = [4, 9]
       ```

   - Continue until end of merged list:
       ```
       right = 12: (30, 2) -> kListFreq = {1: 1, 0: 1, 2: 2}, hasIncluded = 3
       range = [20, 24]
       ```

**Output:**
range = [20, 24]
