# Maximum Swap

## Intuition
The new number can only be larger then the last number, when the smallest number get swapped with the largest number on its right side, within given number.

Consider the number `7007` as an example. The correct output for this number is `7700`. To achieve this, we scan the number from the right side and get the index of the largest value seen so far. Then, we look for all the numbers smaller than this largest number. Swapping these can make a larger number. To make the overall number largest, it's better to have the larger number on the rightmost side and the smaller number (smaller than the largest) on the leftmost side.

For example:
- `7007`: The smallest number is at index 1, and the largest is at index 3. Swapping them makes `7700`.
- `12345`: The largest index is 4, and the smallest is 0, resulting in `42341`.
- `98368`: The largest index is 8, and the smallest is 2, resulting in `98863`. In this case, there is no number smaller than 9, so it is not used.

## Approach
1. Convert the number to a character array.
2. Initialize three variables: `largestIndex`, `prevLargestIndex`, and `smallestIndex` to keep track of the indices.
3. Traverse the character array from right to left:
    - If the current character is larger than the character at `largestIndex`, update `largestIndex`.
    - If the current character is smaller than the character at `largestIndex`, update `prevLargestIndex` and `smallestIndex`.
4. If a valid swap is found (i.e., `smallestIndex` is not -1 and is less than `prevLargestIndex`), swap the characters at `smallestIndex` and `prevLargestIndex`.
5. Convert the character array back to an integer and return it.

## Example Walkthrough
Let's walk through the example with the number `98368`:

1. Convert `98368` to a character array: `['9', '8', '3', '6', '8']`.
2. Initialize `largestIndex = 4`, `prevLargestIndex = 4`, `smallestIndex = 4`.
3. Traverse the array from right to left:
    - At index 3: `chars = '6'` is smaller than `chars = '8'`, so update `prevLargestIndex = 4` and `smallestIndex = 3`.
    - At index 2: `chars = '3'` is smaller than `chars = '8'`, so update `prevLargestIndex = 4` and `smallestIndex = 2`.
    - At index 1: `chars = '8'` is equal to `chars = '8'`, no change.
    - At index 0: `chars = '9'` is larger than `chars = '8'`, update `largestIndex = 0`.
4. Since `smallestIndex = 2` and `smallestIndex < prevLargestIndex`, swap `chars` and `chars`.
5. The array becomes `['9', '8', '8', '6', '3']`.
6. Convert the array back to an integer: `98863`.

Thus, the maximum number obtained by swapping two digits in `98368` is `98863`.
