 * Question Title: 2528. Maximize the Minimum Powered City
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-minimum-powered-city
 * Description: You are given a 0-indexed integer array stations of length n, where stations[i] represents the number of power stations in the ith city.
 * <p>
 * Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range. In other words, if the range is denoted by r, then a power station at city i can provide power to all cities j such that |i - j| <= r and 0 <= i, j <= n - 1.
 * <p>
 * Note that |x| denotes absolute value. For example, |7 - 5| = 2 and |3 - 10| = 7.
 * The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.
 * <p>
 * The government has sanctioned building k more power stations, each of which can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.
 * <p>
 * Given the two integers r and k, return the maximum possible minimum power of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally.
 * <p>
 * Note that you can build the k power stations in multiple cities.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: stations = [1,2,4,5,0], r = 1, k = 2
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
 * One of the optimal ways is to install both the power stations at city 1.
 * So stations will become [1,4,4,5,0].
 * - City 0 is provided by 1 + 4 = 5 power stations.
 * - City 1 is provided by 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 power stations.
 * - City 2 is provided by 4 + 4 + 5 = 13 power stations.
 * - City 3 is provided by 5 + 4 = 9 power stations.
 * - City 4 is provided by 5 + 0 = 5 power stations.
 * So the minimum power of a city is 5.
 * Since it is not possible to obtain a larger power, we return 5.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: stations = [4,4,4,4], r = 0, k = 3
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation:
 * It can be proved that we cannot make the minimum power of a city greater than 4.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * n == stations.length
 * 1 <= n <= 105
 * 0 <= stations[i] <= 105
 * 0 <= r <= n - 1
 * 0 <= k <= 109

    /**
     * Problem Overview
     * We are given an array stations of length n, where stations[i] denotes the number of power stations in city i. By default, each city has access to its own power station(s), so city i has at least stations[i] power.
     * <p>
     * Letâ€™s assume:
     * <p>
     * r = 1, meaning each power station can supply power to its adjacent cities within a radius of 1.
     * <p>
     * k = 0, meaning we are not allowed to add any new power stations.
     * <p>
     * Our goal is to compute the total power available to each city under these constraints.
     * Input:
     * stations = [1, 2, 4, 5, 0], r = 1, k = 0
     * We calculate the power for each city by summing the values in the range [i - r, i + r]:
     * <p>
     * City 0: 1 (self) + 2 (right) = 3
     * <p>
     * City 1: 1 (left) + 2 (self) + 4 (right) = 7
     * <p>
     * City 2: 2 (left) + 4 (self) + 5 (right) = 11
     * <p>
     * City 3: 4 (left) + 5 (self) + 0 (right) = 9
     * <p>
     * City 4: 5 (left) + 0 (self) = 5
     * <p>
     * This method is O(n * r) since for each city we examine up to 2r + 1 elements.
     * <p>
     * Optimization Using Prefix Sum
     * To make this more efficient, especially when r is large, we can use a prefix sum approach to calculate the power for each city in O(1) time per city.
     * <p>
     * Prefix Sum Construction:
     * stations =  [1, 2, 4, 5, 0]
     * prefix    = [1, 3, 7, 12, 12]
     * Power Calculation Using Prefix Sum:
     * power[i] = prefix[min(n - 1, i + r)] - prefix[max(-1, i - r - 1)] if minimumRadius < 0 then reset power to 0, similarly if i+r goes beyond n then reset to n-1
     * Example:
     * <p>
     * power[0] = prefix[1] - prefix[-2] = 3 - 0 = 3 [i-r-1 < 0 ]
     * power[1] = prefix[2] - prefix[-1] = 7
     * ...
     * power[3] = prefix[4] - prefix[1] = 12 - 3 = 9
     * power[4] = prefix[4] - prefix[2] = 12 - 7 = 5 since 4 + r = 5 > 4 hence reset to 4
     * <p>
     * When k > 0: Introducing Extra Stations
     * So far, we assumed k = 0. Now consider k > 0, meaning we can add k extra stations anywhere to maximize the minimum power across all cities.
     * <p>
     * For example, if r = n - 1, each power station affects all cities. The total available power is initially:
     * total_power = prefix[n - 1]
     * After adding k new stations, total power becomes:
     * max_possible_power = prefix[n - 1] + k
     * <p>
     * Binary Search on Answer
     * We binary search on the mid value representing a candidate for the minimum power each city should have. For each mid, we check:
     * <p>
     * Now, for every 'mid' value in the range, we need to check if is possible to obtain 'mid' power by adding k stations.
     * <p>
     * In order to find the do we require k stations or not to get minimum 'mid' power to ith city, we need to try all [i-r,i+r] window power of each city. And check if we add k more station, is it possible to get 'mid' power or not. if not, then we can return false otherwise we can try further with remaining k plants. Since adding 'requiredPlants' will also affect all the city ahead ith city, we will greedly add this power to i+r th city so that it can cover maximum possible city's. And reduce all cities which is not in range
     * i + r + r + 1 would be not in range of (i+r)th city. To accomdated this additional Power, we need another additionalPower array to compute this.
     * <p>
     * Time : O(n) + O(n) + O( n* log(Max)) ; here max is totalSum+k
     * Space: O(n)
