# Intuition
Here the smallest number in the matrix would be `1x1` while the max would be `mxn`. Hence our solution would like b/w [1, m*n]. This makes us to think in binary search. For each mid, if we are able to find how many elements from the matrix are `<=mid` then we can adjust low and high to meet kth element

# Approach

Since the matrix Mxn forms as follows
```
 m=1 then its 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, ... 1xn
 m=2 them its 2x1, 2x2...........2xn
 ...
 m=M than its Mx1, 2x2...........2xn
```
means for each row `[1,m]` as i the row elements are `i, 2i , 3i.... ni`
since these rows are always sorted, we can find that how many elements `are <=mid using (mid / i)`.
```
Example : mid = 5 then  
 m=1 ; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 here 5 / 1 = 5 elements are <=5
 m=2 ; 2, 4, 6..... here 5 / 2 = 2 elements are <=5
 m= 3; 3, 6 ....
 m=4; 4, ...
 m=5; 5.... here 5/5 = 1 elements are <= 5
```
Hence for each row its `min(mid / i, n)` ; we took min with n, since mid could be large number and our last number in the row is `ni`, so maximum n is possible.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
`O(m*log(m*n))`

- Space complexity: `O(1)`
