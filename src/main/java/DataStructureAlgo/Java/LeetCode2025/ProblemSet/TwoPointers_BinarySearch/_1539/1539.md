# 1539. Kth Missing Positive Number

## 🧠 Problem Intuition

You're given a **sorted array of positive integers `arr`**, and an integer `k`.  
The array is strictly increasing, but **some positive integers are missing** from the natural number sequence.

Your goal is to find the **k-th missing positive integer**.

### Example:
```
arr = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11], k = 5  
Missing numbers = [1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, ...]  
The 5th missing number is 9.
```

## 🔍 Key Insight

At each index `i` in the array, you can calculate how many numbers are **missing before** that index using:

```python
missing_count = arr[i] - (i + 1)
```

Why?  
Because if no numbers were missing, we would expect `arr[i]` to be exactly `i + 1`.  
The difference between `arr[i]` and `i + 1` tells us how many numbers are missing up to that point.

## 🚀 Why Binary Search?

We want to find the **smallest index `i`** such that the number of missing elements before `arr[i]` is **at least `k`**.

This condition — "find smallest index satisfying a condition" — is a classic binary search pattern.

We apply binary search on the index range `[0, len(arr) - 1]`:

- If `missing < k`, move right (`left = mid + 1`)
- If `missing >= k`, move left (`right = mid - 1`)

After the loop, `left` is the first index where the number of missing elements is `≥ k`.

---

## ✅ Final Formula: `k + left`

After binary search ends:

- The number of missing integers before index `left` is `< k`
- The k-th missing number is not in the array — it's before or between indices
- Therefore, the k-th missing number is:

```python
k + left
```

### Why `k + left`?

If no numbers were missing, index `left` would contain the number `left + 1`.

But because `left` numbers are **present**, and `k` numbers are **missing**,  
you need to go `k` steps beyond the `left` "non-missing" numbers — hence `k + left`.

## ⏱️ Time Complexity

- Binary Search → `O(log n)`
- Much faster than a brute-force or linear scan (`O(n + k)`)

---

## ✅ Example Dry Run

```
arr = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11], k = 5

Binary Search:
- mid = 2 → arr[2] = 4 → missing = 4 - 3 = 1 < 5 → left = 3
- mid = 3 → arr[3] = 7 → missing = 7 - 4 = 3 < 5 → left = 4
- mid = 4 → arr[4] = 11 → missing = 11 - 5 = 6 ≥ 5 → right = 3

Loop ends → left = 4

Answer = k + left = 5 + 4 = 9
```
