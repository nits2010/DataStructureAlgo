 * Question Category: 2513. Minimize the Maximum of Two Arrays
 * Description: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-the-maximum-of-two-arrays/description
 * We have two arrays arr1 and arr2 which are initially empty. You need to add positive integers to them such that they satisfy all the following conditions:
 * <p>
 * arr1 contains uniqueCnt1 distinct positive integers, each of which is not divisible by divisor1.
 * arr2 contains uniqueCnt2 distinct positive integers, each of which is not divisible by divisor2.
 * No integer is present in both arr1 and arr2.
 * Given divisor1, divisor2, uniqueCnt1, and uniqueCnt2, return the minimum possible maximum integer that can be present in either array.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: divisor1 = 2, divisor2 = 7, uniqueCnt1 = 1, uniqueCnt2 = 3
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation:
 * We can distribute the first 4 natural numbers into arr1 and arr2.
 * arr1 = [1] and arr2 = [2,3,4].
 * We can see that both arrays satisfy all the conditions.
 * Since the maximum value is 4, we return it.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: divisor1 = 3, divisor2 = 5, uniqueCnt1 = 2, uniqueCnt2 = 1
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * Here arr1 = [1,2], and arr2 = [3] satisfy all conditions.
 * Since the maximum value is 3, we return it.
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: divisor1 = 2, divisor2 = 4, uniqueCnt1 = 8, uniqueCnt2 = 2
 * Output: 15
 * Explanation:
 * Here, the final possible arrays can be arr1 = [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15], and arr2 = [2,6].
 * It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a lower maximum satisfying all conditions.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 2 <= divisor1, divisor2 <= 105
 * 1 <= uniqueCnt1, uniqueCnt2 < 109
 * 2 <= uniqueCnt1 + uniqueCnt2 <= 109

     * - All numbers must be distinct

     * - We have enough numbers not divisible by divisor1 to fill A1
     * - Enough not divisible by divisor2 to fill A2
     * - And any shortfall can be covered using the remaining numbers
     *
     * To avoid double-counting, we exclude numbers divisible by both divisors using LCM
     * LCM = (divisor1 * divisor2) / GCD(divisor1 , divisor2)
     * gcd(a,b) = ( a == 0 ? b : gcd(b%a, a) )  where b > a
