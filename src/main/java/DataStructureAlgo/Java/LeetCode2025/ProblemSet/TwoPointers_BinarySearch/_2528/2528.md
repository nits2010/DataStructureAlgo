# Problem Overview

We are given an array `stations` of length `n`, where `stations[i]` denotes the number of power stations in city `i`.  
By default, each city has access to its own power station(s), so city `i` has at least `stations[i]` power.

Let‚Äôs assume:

- `r = 1`, meaning each power station can supply power to its adjacent cities within a radius of 1.
- `k = 0`, meaning we are not allowed to add any new power stations.

Our goal is to compute the total power available to each city under these constraints.

## Input
```
stations = [1, 2, 4, 5, 0]
r = 1
k = 0
```

We calculate the power for each city by summing the values in the range `[i - r, i + r]`:

- City 0: 1 (self) + 2 (right) = **3**
- City 1: 1 (left) + 2 (self) + 4 (right) = **7**
- City 2: 2 (left) + 4 (self) + 5 (right) = **11**
- City 3: 4 (left) + 5 (self) + 0 (right) = **9**
- City 4: 5 (left) + 0 (self) = **5**

This method is **O(n * r)** since for each city we examine up to `2r + 1` elements.

## Optimization Using Prefix Sum

To make this more efficient, especially when `r` is large, we can use a prefix sum approach to calculate the power for each city in **O(1)** time per city.

### Prefix Sum Construction:
```
stations =  [1, 2, 4, 5, 0]
prefix    = [1, 3, 7, 12, 12]
```

### Power Calculation Using Prefix Sum:
```
power[i] = prefix[min(n - 1, i + r)] - prefix[max(-1, i - r - 1)]
```
- If `i - r - 1 < 0`, treat it as 0.
- If `i + r >= n`, clamp to `n - 1`.

### Examples:

- `power[0] = prefix[1] - 0 = 3`
- `power[1] = prefix[2] - 0 = 7`
- `power[2] = prefix[3] - prefix[0] = 12 - 1 = 11`
- `power[3] = prefix[4] - prefix[1] = 12 - 3 = 9`
- `power[4] = prefix[4] - prefix[2] = 12 - 7 = 5`

## When k > 0: Introducing Extra Stations

So far, we assumed `k = 0`. Now consider `k > 0`, meaning we can add `k` extra stations anywhere to **maximize the minimum power** across all cities.

For example, if `r = n - 1`, each power station affects **all cities**.  
The total available power is initially:
```
total_power = prefix[n - 1]
```
After adding `k` new stations:
```
max_possible_power = prefix[n - 1] + k
```

## Binary Search on Answer

We binary search on the `mid` value representing a candidate for the minimum power each city should have. For each `mid`, we check:

- Can we ensure every city has at least `mid` power by **adding at most k stations**?

For each `mid`, simulate city powers using a **greedy sliding window**:

1. Traverse each city from 0 to n-1.
2. If the city's total power (within `[i - r, i + r]` window) is less than `mid`, add the necessary power to the farthest possible city (`i + r`) to **cover the widest future range**.
3. Use a difference array or an auxiliary `additionalPower[]` to track added power effects.
4. Make sure added power is removed after its effect ends (`i + r + r + 1`).

# üìò Algorithm: Maximize Minimum Power of Cities

This algorithm finds the **maximum possible minimum power** for each city, given:
- `stations[]`: Initial power stations at each city.
- `r`: Range of power influence from a power station.
- `k`: Number of additional power stations that can be added.

## üîß 1. getPrefixSum(int[] stations)
**Purpose:** Compute prefix sum to enable O(1) range queries.

### Steps:
1. Initialize `prefixSum[0] = stations[0]`
2. For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`:
    - `prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + stations[i]`
3. Return `prefixSum`

## üîß 2. getPowerOfCities(long[] prefixSum, int r)
**Purpose:** Compute the power of each city using prefix sums.

### Steps:
1. For each city `i`:
    - Define range as `[i - r, i + r]` (bounded by array limits).
    - Calculate power using prefix sums.
        - `excludedPower = prefixSum[i - r - 1]` if `i - r - 1 >= 0`, else 0
        - `power[i] = prefixSum[min(i + r, n - 1)] - excludedPower`
2. Return `power[]`

## üß† 3. maxPower(int[] stations, int r, int k)
**Purpose:** Binary search to find maximum minimum power that can be achieved.

### Steps:
1. Compute `prefixSum` and `power` arrays.
2. Binary search in range `[0, totalPower + k]`:
    - If `isPossible()` with `mid` power, try to increase it.
    - Else, reduce the range.

## ‚úÖ 4. isPossible(...)
**Purpose:** Check if all cities can have at least `minimumPower` with at most `k` extra stations.

### Steps:
1. Initialize `additionalPower[]` = 0 for all cities.
2. For each city `i`:
    - `power = power[i] + additionalPower[i]` (include cumulative additions)
    - If `power < minimumPower`:
        - Compute `required = minimumPower - power`
        - If `required > available`, return `false`
        - Deduct from `availablePowerStations`
        - Add `required` to `additionalPower[i]`
        - Subtract `required` from `additionalPower[i + 2r + 1]` to limit influence window
3. If loop finishes, return `true`
