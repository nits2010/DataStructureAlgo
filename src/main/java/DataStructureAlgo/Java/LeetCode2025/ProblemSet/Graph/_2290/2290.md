# [ 2290. Minimum Obstacle Removal to Reach Corner](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-obstacle-removal-to-reach-corner/description)

## Intuition-Visited[TLE]

To navigate through a grid with the fewest obstacles, we model the problem as the shortest path problem in a weighted
graph. Each cell in the grid can be viewed as a node, and moving from one cell to another can be viewed as an edge with
a certain cost (obstacle). The goal is to find the path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner with the
minimum total cost (minimum obstacles encountered). Using a priority queue (min-heap), we can implement Dijkstra's
algorithm to efficiently find the minimum cost path.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Create a `PriorityQueue` named `pq` to store the current cell position and the cost to reach that cell, sorted by
      cost.
    - Create a `boolean` 2D array named `visited` to keep track of visited cells.
    - Initialize the priority queue with the starting cell `(0, 0)` and its cost (the value of the top-left cell).

2. **Explore the Grid**:
    - Use the priority queue to explore the grid. In each iteration, dequeue the cell with the minimum cost.
    - If the current cell is the bottom-right corner, return the accumulated cost as the result.
    - Mark the current cell as visited.
    - Explore all four possible directions (up, down, left, right). For each direction, calculate the new cell position
      and the new accumulated cost. If the new cell is within bounds and not visited, add it to the priority queue with
      the updated cost.

3. **Check Bounds**:
    - Implement a helper method `isSafe` to check if a cell is within the grid bounds.

4. **Result**:
    - If the priority queue is exhausted and the bottom-right corner is not reached, return `-1`.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**:
    - Initializing the priority queue and visited array takes `O(1)` and `O(m*n)` respectively.
- **Grid Exploration**:
    - In the worst case, all cells might be added to the priority queue. Each cell is processed once, and there are up
      to four neighbors to explore for each cell. Using a priority queue, each insertion and deletion operation
      takes `O(log(m*n))`.
    - Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(m*n*log(m*n))`.

### Space Complexity

- **Priority Queue**:
    - The priority queue stores the cells being processed, which can be at most `O(m*n)` in size.
- **Visited Array**:
    - The `visited` array requires `O(m*n)` space.
    - Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(m*n)`.

## Intuition-Dijkstra

In the above approach, we added all the four-direction possibilities in PQ, without considering the minimum cost of
reaching there. There is no advantage of
adding those cells where reaching will make more cost than existing one.Hence, just like Dijkstra, we will maintain
distance array aka costs matrix.
That hols the cost of reaching (i,j) from (0,0).

## Approach

### Step-by-Step

1. **Initialization**:
    - Create a `PriorityQueue` named `pq` to store the current cell position and the cost to reach that cell, sorted by
      cost.
    - Create a `boolean` 2D array named `visited` to keep track of visited cells.
    - Initialize the priority queue with the starting cell `(0, 0)` and its cost (the value of the top-left cell).

2. **Grid Exploration**:
    - Use the priority queue to explore the grid. In each iteration, dequeue the cell with the minimum cost.
    - If the current cell is the bottom-right corner, return the accumulated cost as the result.
    - Mark the current cell as visited.
    - Explore all four possible directions (up, down, left, right). For each direction, calculate the new cell position
      and the `new accumulated cost`. If the new cell is within bounds and has `less cost`, add it to the priority queue
      with
      the updated cost.

3. **Check Bounds**:
    - Implement a helper method `isSafe` to check if a cell is within the grid bounds.

4. **Result**:
    - If the priority queue is exhausted and the bottom-right corner is not reached, return `-1`.

## Intuition-0-1 BFS

This is another interesting approach. As in problem, we have only two choices of possibilities of cost, either the cost
of reaching (i,j) remains the same (hence cost 0),
or it will increase by 1 (because of obstacles). Which makes the new cost will always be either increasing by 1 or none.
So, that makes priority queue useless as we always prefer to visit the node which has `0` cost first to explore it fully
rather than the node with has `1` cost.
This is same maintained by priority queue and it's costing us `O(log(m*n))` time, which can be reduced to `O(1)` by
using Deque.

 Using a deque (double-ended queue), we can implement a 0â€“1 BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm to efficiently find the minimum
cost path.

## Approach

### Step-by-Step

1. **Initialization**:
    - Create a `Deque` named `deque` to store the current cell position and the cost to reach that cell. Initialize with
      the starting cell `(0, 0)` and its cost.
    - Create a `boolean` 2D array named `visited` to keep track of visited cells.
    - Mark the starting cell `(0, 0)` as visited.

2. **Grid Exploration**:
    - Use the deque to explore the grid. In each iteration, dequeue the cell from the front.
    - If the current cell is the bottom-right corner, return the accumulated cost as the result.
    - Mark the current cell as visited.
    - Explore all four possible directions (up, down, left, right). For each direction, calculate the new cell position.
    - If the new cell is within bounds and not visited, mark it as visited and add it to the deque with the updated
      cost:
        - If the cost to reach the new cell is higher (i.e., grid value is 1), add it to the back of the deque.
        - If the cost to reach the new cell is lower (i.e., grid value is 0), add it to the front of the deque.

3. **Check Bounds**:
    - Implement a helper method `isSafe` to check if a cell is within the grid bounds.

4. **Result**:
    - If the deque is exhausted and the bottom-right corner is not reached, return `-1`.
