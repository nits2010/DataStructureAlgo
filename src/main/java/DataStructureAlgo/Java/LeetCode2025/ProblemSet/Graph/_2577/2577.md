# [2577. Minimum Time to Visit a Cell In a Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-visit-a-cell-in-a-grid/description/)

## Approach: Modified Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Intuition

We are given a matrix grid where each cell contains the minimum time required for that cell to be accessible. In other
words, if we begin at the top-left cell and each move takes 1 second, the value in each cell tells us the minimum time
after which we can enter it.

The challenge arises when we find ourselves stuck in a cell, unable to move forward because all neighboring cells are
inaccessible, with higher minimum times. In such situations, we must "waste" time to move forward. How do we do that? By
wandering around! We can move back and forth between the current cell and any previously accessible cells until a
neighboring cell becomes accessible.

The time we need to "waste" is determined by the difference between the current cell’s time and the minimum time of an
accessible neighboring cell. Each unit of time wasted takes 2 seconds since we travel to a previous cell and return to
the current cell. Therefore, if the difference between the current time and the target cell's time is odd, we can step
into the target cell exactly when it becomes accessible. Otherwise, if the difference is even, we’ll arrive at the
target cell 1 second after it has opened.

If we are at the top-left corner and all neighboring cells have a minimum time greater than 1, we are stuck, and the
solution is not possible. In this case, we return -1. Otherwise, a solution exists.

We can apply Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm with a priority queue, starting from the top-left cell. Each element in
the queue holds the cell’s coordinates and the time taken to reach it, ordered by time in ascending order. We also
maintain a visited matrix to track the cells we have already processed. For each cell in the queue, we check its
neighbors, compute the time required to enter each one, and add any accessible neighbors to the queue, adjusting for the
waiting time. When we reach the bottom-right corner, we return the associated time as the final answer.

## Algorithm

1. **Initial Check**:
    - Check if both initial moves (right and down) in the grid require more than 1 second:
        - If both `grid[0][1] > 1` and `grid[1][0] > 1`, return -1 because it’s impossible to proceed.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
    - `rows` and `cols` store the dimensions of the grid.
    - `directions` array defines the possible moves: down, up, right, and left.
    - `visited` array keeps track of visited cells.
    - `pq` is a priority queue that stores `{time, row, col}` tuples, ordered by minimum time to reach each cell.

3. **Add Starting Point**:
    - Add the starting point (top-left cell) to the priority queue with its initial time (`grid[0][0]`).

4. **Process Priority Queue**:
    - While the priority queue is not empty:
        - Poll the cell with the minimum time `(time, row, col)`.
        - If the target cell (bottom-right) is reached, return the time.
        - Skip the current cell if it has already been visited.
        - Mark the current cell as visited.
        - For each of the four possible directions:
            - Calculate the next cell coordinates `(nextRow, nextCol)`.
            - If the cell is valid (within bounds and not visited), calculate the additional wait time for the next
              cell:
                - If the difference between the grid value and the current time is even, the additional wait time is 1.
                - Otherwise, the wait time is 0.
            - Calculate the next possible time based on the grid value and the wait time, and add the
              new `{nextTime, nextRow, nextCol}` to the priority queue.

5. **Return Result**:
    - If the loop ends without reaching the target, return -1 (no path found).

#### Helper Function `isValid`

- Check if a cell is within bounds and has not been visited.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**:
    - Initializing the priority queue and visited array takes `O(1)` and `O(m*n)` respectively.
- **Grid Exploration**:
    - In the worst case, all cells might be added to the priority queue. Each cell is processed once, and there are up
      to four neighbors to explore for each cell. Using a priority queue, each insertion and deletion operation
      takes `O(log(m*n))`.
    - Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(m*n*log(m*n))`.

### Space Complexity

- **Priority Queue**:
    - The priority queue stores the cells being processed, which can be at most `O(m*n)` in size.
- **Visited Array**:
    - The `visited` array requires `O(m*n)` space.

Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(m*n)`.
