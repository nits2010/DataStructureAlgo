# Shortest Distance After Queries

## Intuition

The goal is to determine the shortest distance from node `0` to node `n-1` after each query. Each query adds a new edge
to the graph, and we need to recalculate the shortest distance after incorporating the new edge. This problem can be
effectively solved using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for each query.

## Approach - Dijkstra's Algorithm

### Step-by-Step

1. **Graph Initialization**:
    - We initialize an adjacency list `adjList` to represent the graph.
    - Initially, each node `i` is connected to node `i+1`.

2. **Processing Queries**:
    - For each query, add the specified edge to the graph.
    - Compute the shortest distance from node `0` to node `n-1` using Dijkstra's algorithm.
    - Store the result for each query.

3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
    - Initialize a distance array `distance` with a high value (`n+1`), where `distance[source] = 0`.
    - Use a priority queue to repeatedly select the node with the smallest known distance.
    - For each selected node, update the distances to its adjacent nodes if a shorter path is found.
    - Mark nodes as visited once their shortest distance is confirmed.
    - Return the distance to node `n-1` after processing all nodes.

# Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The primary operations involved are adding edges to the graph and computing the shortest distance using Dijkstra's
algorithm after each query.

1. **Graph Initialization**:
    - Initializing the adjacency list for `n` nodes takes `O(n)` time.
    - Initial connections (where each node `i` is connected to node `i+1`) take `O(n)` time.

2. **Processing Queries**:
    - For each query, adding an edge to the graph takes `O(1)` time.
    - Computing the shortest distance using Dijkstra's algorithm:
        - Dijkstra's algorithm, with a priority queue, has a time complexity of `O(E * log(V))`, where `E` is the number
          of edges and `V` is the number of vertices.
        - For each node, the adjacency list might grow with each query, leading to a potential increase in the number of
          edges `E`.

Given `Q` queries, the overall time complexity becomes `Q * O(E * log(V))`, where `E` can be considered as the sum of
all edges added over the queries.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(Q * E * log(V))`.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity involves storing the graph and the additional data structures used in Dijkstra's algorithm.

1. **Graph Storage**:
    - The adjacency list requires `O(V + E)` space, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.
    - Initially, there are `n` nodes with `n-1` edges, so `O(n + (n-1)) = O(n)` space. However, with queries, more edges
      are added, increasing `E`.

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
    - The distance array requires `O(V)` space.
    - The priority queue also requires `O(V)` space.
    - The visited array requires `O(V)` space.

Combining these, the overall space complexity is `O(V + E)`, which simplifies to `O(n + E)`.

Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(n + E)`.

## Approachâ€”Bellman Ford Algorithm[TLE]

## Intuition

The goal is to determine the shortest distance from node `0` to node `n-1` after each query. Each query adds a new edge
to the graph, and we need to recalculate the shortest distance after incorporating the new edge. This problem can be
effectively solved using the Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm for each query.

## Approach

### Step-by-Step

1. **Graph Initialization**:
    - We initialize an edge list `edgeList` to represent the graph.
    - Initially, each node `i` is connected to node `i+1`.

2. **Processing Queries**:
    - For each query, add the specified edge to the graph.
    - Compute the shortest distance from node `0` to node `n-1` using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
    - Store the result for each query.

3. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**:
    - Initialize a distance array `distance` with a high value (`n+1`), where `distance[source] = 0`.
    - Relax all edges `n-1` times.
    - For each edge, update the distances to its target nodes if a shorter path is found.
    - Return the distance to node `n-1` after processing all edges.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The primary operations involved are adding edges to the graph and computing the shortest distance using the Bellman-Ford
algorithm after each query.

1. **Graph Initialization**:
    - Initializing the edge list for `n` nodes takes `O(n)` time.
    - Initial connections (where each node `i` is connected to node `i+1`) take `O(n)` time.

2. **Processing Queries**:
    - For each query, adding an edge to the graph takes `O(1)` time.
    - Computing the shortest distance using the Bellman-Ford algorithm:
        - Bellman-Ford algorithm has a time complexity of `O(V * E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the
          number of edges.

Given `Q` queries, the overall time complexity becomes `Q * O(V * E)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(Q * V * E)`.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity involves storing the graph and the additional data structures used in the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

1. **Graph Storage**:
    - The edge list requires `O(E)` space, where `E` is the number of edges.
    - Initially, there are `n` nodes with `n-1` edges, so `O(n + (n-1)) = O(n)` space. However, with queries, more edges
      are added, increasing `E`.

2. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**:
    - The distance array requires `O(V)` space.

Combining these, the overall space complexity is `O(V + E)`.

Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(n + E)`.


## Efficient Approaches
Each node is a distance of 1 away from its neighbor, so a simple BFS will suffice.

# Approach 1: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## Intuition

The problem statement naturally suggests a graphical representation, where cities are modeled as nodes and the roads
connecting them are represented as edges. This transforms our task into a well-known graph problem: finding the shortest
path between two nodes.

However, there's an important distinction: our graph is dynamic, with new edges added at each step. A logical approach
is to update the graph with each new road and apply a path-finding algorithm at each step to find the shortest path.

To select the appropriate algorithm, we need to consider the properties of our graph. One notable characteristic is that
the edges are unweighted. This implies that the total cost of a path is equivalent to the number of steps taken to reach
the destination, or, in other words, the number of layers of nodes that must be explored.

This understanding leads us to implement the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is particularly suited for this
type of problem.

### Algorithm

#### Step-by-Step

### Graph Initialization
1. Initialize an adjacency list `adjList` to represent the graph with `n` nodes.
2. For each node `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
    - Add an empty list to `adjList` for each node.
    - If `i` is not the last node, add a directed edge from node `i` to node `i+1`.

### Processing Queries
1. Initialize an array `result` to store the shortest distances after each query.
2. For each query:
    - Add the specified edge to the adjacency list `adjList`.
    - Compute the shortest distance from node `0` to node `n-1` using the BFS algorithm.
    - Store the result of the BFS computation in the `result` array.

### BFS Algorithm
1. Initialize a queue for BFS and a distance array to keep track of the shortest distance to each node.
2. Start from the source node:
    - Offer the source node and distance `0` to the queue.
    - Mark the source node as visited.
3. While the queue is not empty:
    - Poll the front element of the queue (current node and its distance).
    - If the current node is the destination node, return the distance.
    - For each adjacent node of the current node:
        - If the adjacent node is not visited:
            - Mark it as visited.
            - Offer the adjacent node and its distance (current distance + 1) to the queue.
4. If the destination node is not reachable, return `-1`.

algorithm after each query.

1. **Graph Initialization**:
    - Initializing the adjacency list for `n` nodes takes `O(n)` time.
    - Initial connections (where each node `i` is connected to node `i+1`) take `O(n)` time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(Q * (V + E))`.
