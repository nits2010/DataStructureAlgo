Question Title:  3470. Permutations IV
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations-iv/description/
Description: Given two integers, n and k, an alternating permutation is a permutation of the first n positive integers such that no two adjacent elements are both odd or both even.

Return the k-th alternating permutation sorted in lexicographical order. If there are fewer than k valid alternating permutations, return an empty list.



Example 1:

Input: n = 4, k = 6

Output: [3,4,1,2]

Explanation:

The lexicographically-sorted alternating permutations of [1, 2, 3, 4] are:

[1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 4, 3, 2]
[2, 1, 4, 3]
[2, 3, 4, 1]
[3, 2, 1, 4]
[3, 4, 1, 2] ‚Üê 6th permutation
[4, 1, 2, 3]
[4, 3, 2, 1]
Since k = 6, we return [3, 4, 1, 2].

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, k = 2

Output: [3,2,1]

Explanation:

The lexicographically-sorted alternating permutations of [1, 2, 3] are:

[1, 2, 3]
[3, 2, 1] ‚Üê 2nd permutation
Since k = 2, we return [3, 2, 1].

Example 3:

Input: n = 2, k = 3

Output: []

Explanation:

The lexicographically-sorted alternating permutations of [1, 2] are:

[1, 2]
[2, 1]
There are only 2 alternating permutations, but k = 3, which is out of range. Thus, we return an empty list [].



Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
1 <= k <= 10^15

            ### üî¢ Key Observations

            1. We have exactly `n` slots to fill with values from `1` to `n`.
            2. **Parity constraints**:

            * If `n` is **odd**, the first number **must be odd**, since there will be one more odd number than even.
            * If `n` is **even**, the first number can be either **odd or even**, and the rest of the permutation must follow alternating parity.

            ### ‚öôÔ∏è Optimization Insight

            Instead of generating all alternating permutations and sorting them to find the `k-th`, which is infeasible for large `n`, we build the permutation **one position at a time**, computing how many valid permutations exist for each choice,
            and **skip over blocks** of permutations accordingly.

            This is achieved using **counting logic**, by computing:

            ```
            ways = factorial(even_remaining) * factorial(odd_remaining)
            ```

            ...which gives the number of valid alternating permutations from the current point onward.

            ### üìö Example Walkthrough

            Let‚Äôs say `n = 4` and `k = 6`. Our available numbers are `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

            * Try placing `1` at the first position:

            * Remaining numbers: `[2, 3, 4]`
            * Valid permutations starting with `[1]`: 2 (`[1,2,3,4]`, `[1,4,3,2]`)
            * Since `k = 6 > 2`, skip these ‚Üí `k = 6 - 2 = 4`

            * Try placing `2` at the first position:

            * Remaining numbers: `[1, 3, 4]`
            * Valid permutations: 2 (`[2,1,4,3]`, `[2,3,4,1]`)
            * `k = 4 > 2` ‚Üí skip again ‚Üí `k = 4 - 2 = 2`

            * Try placing `3` at the first position:

            * Remaining numbers: `[1, 2, 4]`
            * Valid permutations: 2 (`[3,2,1,4]`, `[3,4,1,2]`)
            * `k = 2 <= 2` ‚Üí Accept `3` as the first number

            Repeat this logic recursively for the next positions using the updated value of `k` and updated remaining numbers.

            ### ‚úÖ Parity Handling

            At each step, enforce the alternating parity by:

            * Checking if the number you're placing matches the expected parity
            * Updating `parity_needed` based on the last placed number:

            ```
            parity_needed = 1 - (last_number % 2)
            ```

            The only exception is at the first position **when `n` is even**, where both odd and even numbers are allowed.
            :return:
            :param n:
            :param k:
            :return: kth lexicographically sorted permutation or []
