# Intuition, Approach, Complexity, and Example

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, remove characters from the string such that no three consecutive characters are the same. Return the resulting string.

## Intuition-LastTwoCharMatch

1. **Character Filtering**:
    - Iterate through the string and build a new string where no character appears more than twice consecutively.

2. **StringBuilder for Efficiency**:
    - Use a `StringBuilder` to efficiently append characters and form the result string.

## Approach

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
    - If the string is null or has less than 3 characters, return the string as it is.

2. **Initialization**:
    - Convert the string to a character array for easy access.
    - Initialize a `StringBuilder` and add the first two characters to it.

3. **Iterate and Filter**:
    - Start iterating from the third character.
    - Append the current character to the `StringBuilder` only if it doesnâ€™t form three consecutive characters with the last two appended characters.

4. **Return Result**:
    - Convert the `StringBuilder` to a string and return it.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, for the `StringBuilder` to store the result.

## Example Walkthrough

| Step         | Input          | Output (`out`)    | Comments                                  |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Initialization | `"aaabaaaa"`  | `"aa"`            | Start with first two characters            |
| Iteration 1   | `"aaabaaaa"`  | `"aab"`           | Append `'b'` (not three consecutive)       |
| Iteration 2   | `"aaabaaaa"`  | `"aab"`           | Skip `'a'` (would form "aaa")             |
| Iteration 3   | `"aaabaaaa"`  | `"aaba"`          | Append `'a'`                              |
| Iteration 4   | `"aaabaaaa"`  | `"aabaa"`         | Append `'a'`                              |
| Iteration 5   | `"aaabaaaa"`  | `"aabaa"`         | Skip `'a'` (would form "aaa")             |
| Iteration 6   | `"aaabaaaa"`  | `"aabaa"`         | Skip `'a'` (would form "aaa")             |
| Result        | `"aaabaaaa"`  | `"aabaa"`         | Final result string after filtering       |

    - If the string is null or has less than 3 characters, return the string as it is.

2. **Initialization**:
    - Convert the string to a character array for easy access.
    - Initialize a `StringBuilder` with the first character of the string.
    - Use variables to keep track of the last character and its count.

3. **Iterate and Filter**:
    - Start iterating from the second character.
    - Increment the count if the current character is the same as the last one.
    - Reset the count if it's a different character.
    - Append the current character to the `StringBuilder` only if the count is less than 3.

4. **Return Result**:
    - Convert the `StringBuilder` to a string and return it.
