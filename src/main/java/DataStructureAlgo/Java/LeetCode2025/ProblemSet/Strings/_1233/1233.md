# Intuition and Approach for `removeSubfolders` Method
[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-sub-folders-from-the-filesystem/solutions/5966437/multiple-solution-easy-to-understand)
## Intuition-UsingSet

The problem requires removing subfolders from a list of folder paths. A subfolder is defined as any folder that is contained within another folder. For example, `/a/b` is a subfolder of `/a`. 
The goal is to return a list of folders with all subfolders removed.

We can use Set to quickly scan that if the current folder under examination has parent path exists in set or not. If it exists, then it is a subfolder and we can skip it. Otherwise, we can add it to the set.
However, if the folders are not sorted lexicographically, then we need to sort them first to ensure that any subfolder will appear immediately after its parent folder in the sorted order. This makes it easier to identify and skip subfolders.


## Approach

1. **Sort the Folders**:
    - First, we sort the array of folder paths. Sorting helps in ensuring that any subfolder will appear immediately after its parent folder in the sorted order. This makes it easier to identify and skip subfolders.

2. **Use a Set for Unique Folders**:
    - We use a `HashSet` to store the unique folders that are not subfolders. The set helps in quick lookup to check if a folder is a subfolder of any previously added folder.

3. **Iterate Through the Folders**:
    - We start by adding the first folder to the set since it cannot be a subfolder of any previous folder (as there are none).
    - For each subsequent folder, we check if it is a subfolder of any folder already in the set. This is done by building the folder path character by character and checking if any prefix of the current folder exists in the set.

4. **Check for Subfolders**:
    - While iterating through the characters of the current folder, if we encounter a `/` and the prefix up to this point exists in the set, we break out of the loop as it indicates the current folder is a subfolder.
    - If we complete the iteration without finding any prefix in the set, we add the current folder to the set.

5. **Return the Result**:
    - Finally, we convert the set to a list and return it as the result.

### Complexity Analysis
#### Time Complexity:
Sorting the folders takes `(O(n * log n))`, where (`n`) is the number of folders.
The loop to check each folder takes `(O(m))`, where (`m`) is the average length of the folder path.
Overall, the time complexity is `(O(n * m * log n )`.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is (`O(n)`) for storing the folders in the list.

## Intuition-UsingList
The one advantage which we are missing post sorting in above solution is that, if next is a sub-folder, then it must be the sub-folder of previous folder only because of sorting. 
We can eliminate this and directly check if the current folder is a sub-folder of previous folder or not. If it is not, then we can add it to the result list.

## Approach

1. **Sort the Folders**:
    - First, we sort the array of folder paths. Sorting helps in ensuring that any subfolder will appear immediately after its parent folder in the sorted order. This makes it easier to identify and skip subfolders.

2. **Use a List for Unique Folders**:
    - We use an `ArrayList` to store the unique folders that are not subfolders. The list helps in maintaining the order of folders as they appear after sorting.

3. **Iterate Through the Folders**:
    - We start by adding the first folder to the list since it cannot be a subfolder of any previous folder (as there are none).
    - For each subsequent folder, we check if it is a subfolder of the last folder added to the list. This is done by checking if the current folder starts with the last folder plus a `/`.

4. **Check for Subfolders**:
    - If the current folder does not start with the last folder plus a `/`, it means the current folder is not a subfolder and should be added to the list.

5. **Return the Result**:
    - Finally, we return the list as the result.



### Complexity Analysis
#### Time Complexity:
Sorting the folders takes `(O(n * log n))`, where (`n`) is the number of folders.
The loop to check each folder takes `(O(m))`, where (`m`) is the average length of the folder path.
Overall, the time complexity is `(O(n * m * log n )`.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is (`O(n)`) for storing the folders in the list.


## Intuition-UsingTrie

Using a Trie (prefix tree) is an efficient way to solve this problem because it allows us to store the folder paths in a hierarchical structure, making it easy to identify and skip subfolders.

## Approach

1. **Define the TrieNode Class**:
    - Each `TrieNode` represents a part of the folder path. It contains a map of child nodes, a boolean to indicate if it is a leaf node (end of a folder path), and the value of the node.

2. **Insert Method**:
    - The `insert` method takes an array of folder names and inserts them into the Trie. It iterates through the folder names, creating new nodes as necessary, and marks the end of a folder path with `isLeaf = true`.

3. **Search Method**:
    - The `search` method checks if a given folder path is a subfolder. It traverses the Trie using the folder names and stops if it encounters a leaf node, indicating that the current folder is a subfolder.

4. **Build the Trie**:
    - We first build the Trie by inserting all folder paths into it. This step ensures that the Trie contains all the folder paths in a hierarchical structure.

5. **Cross-Check Folders**:
    - After building the Trie, we iterate through the folder paths again and use the `search` method to check if each folder is a subfolder. If it is not a subfolder, we add it to the output list.

6. **Return the Result**:
    - Finally, we return the list of folders that are not subfolders.

### Complexity Analysis
#### Time Complexity:
Building the Trie takes `(O(n*m))`, where (`n`) is the number of folders and (`m`) is the average length of the folder path.
Searching each folder in the Trie also takes `(O(n * m))`.
Overall, the time complexity is `(O(n*m))`.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is `(O(n * m))` for storing the folders in the Trie.

## Intuition-UsingTrie2
We can combine search and insert into single call. To do, we have to process them based on parent first and child second format, which is nothing but length of string in folder. 
We can insert the folder path into trie and check if it is a sub-folder or not. If it is not, then we can add it to the result list.


## Approach

1. **Sort the Folders**:
    - First, we sort the folder paths by their length. This ensures that we process parent folders before their subfolders.

2. **TrieNode Class**:
    - We define a `TrieNode` class to represent each node in the Trie. Each node has:
        - `isLeaf`: A boolean indicating if the node represents the end of a folder path.
        - `value`: The value of the node (folder name).
        - `childs`: A map of child nodes.

3. **Insert and Search Methods**:
    - `insert(String[] names)`: This method inserts a folder path into the Trie.
    - `search(String[] names)`: This method searches for a folder path in the Trie and returns `true` if the path is not a subfolder of any existing folder in the Trie.

4. **Building the Trie**:
    - We initialize the root of the Trie.
    - For each folder in the sorted list:
        - Split the folder path into its components.
        - Use the `search` method to check if the folder is a subfolder of any existing folder in the Trie.
        - If it is not a subfolder, add it to the output list and insert it into the Trie using the `insert` method.

5. **Return the Result**:
    - Finally, return the list of folders that are not subfolders of any other folder.
e return the list of folders that are not subfolders.

### Complexity Analysis
#### Time Complexity: 
`(O(n*log n + n*m))`, where (`n`) is the number of folders and (`m`) is the average length of the folder path.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is `(O(n * m))` for storing the folders in the Trie.
