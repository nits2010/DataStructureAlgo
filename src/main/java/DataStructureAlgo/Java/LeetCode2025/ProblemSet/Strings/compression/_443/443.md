# [443. String Compression](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/description/)

## Problem Statement

Given a character array `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:
1. Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in `chars`:
    - If the group's length is 1, append the character to `s`.
    - Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
2. The compressed string `s` should not be returned directly; instead, modify the input array `chars` in-place to store the compressed string and return the new length of the array.

## Intuition

- We need to iterate through the array and count consecutive repeating characters.
- Use two pointers:
    1. `i` to iterate through the array.
    2. `r` to keep track of the position to modify the array for the compressed string.
- For each character group, if the length is greater than 1, convert the length to a string and add each character of the string to the array.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Define the length of the array `n`.
    - Initialize pointers `i` (to iterate through the array) and `r` (to modify the array for the compressed string).

2. **Iterate and Count**:
    - For each character, count the number of consecutive repetitions.
    - Store the character in the `r` position and increment `r`.
    - If the count is greater than 1, convert the count to a character array and store each character in the `r` position.

3. **Return Result**:
    - Return the new length of the modified array.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array. We iterate through each character once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we modify the input array in place without using additional space.

## Example Walkthrough

Let's consider an example with the input array `chars = ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c']`.

The final compressed array is `['a', '2', 'b', '2', 'c', '3']` and the returned length is 6.
