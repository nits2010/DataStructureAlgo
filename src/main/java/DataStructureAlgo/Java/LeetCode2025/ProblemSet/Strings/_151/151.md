### Intuition and Algorithm for `reverseWords`
[Leecode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/solutions/5883726/easy-solution)
#### Intuition
The goal is to reverse the order of the words in a given string `s`. Each word is considered as a sequence of non-space characters. The key idea is to reverse the entire string first and then reverse each individual word to place the words in the correct order.

#### Algorithm

1. **Reverse the Entire String**:
    - Reverse the entire string `s`.
    - Split the reversed string into words using space as the delimiter.

2. **Reverse Each Individual Word**:
    - Iterate through the split words.
    - For each word, reverse it again to get the correct word order.
    - Append the reversed word to the result string.

3. **Handle Spaces**:
    - Ensure spaces are correctly placed between words in the final result.

4. **Return the Result**:
    - Return the final string with the words in reversed order.

#### Example
Let's consider an example to illustrate the process:

**Input:** `s = "The quick brown fox"`
- **Step 1:** Reverse the entire string: `"xof nworb kciuq ehT"`
- **Step 2:** Split the reversed string into words: `["xof", "nworb", "kciuq", "ehT"]`
- **Step 3:** Reverse each individual word:
    - `reverse("xof") -> "fox"`
    - `reverse("nworb") -> "brown"`
    - `reverse("kciuq") -> "quick"`
    - `reverse("ehT") -> "The"`
- **Step 4:** Combine the reversed words with spaces: `"fox brown quick The"`

**Output:** `"fox brown quick The"`
