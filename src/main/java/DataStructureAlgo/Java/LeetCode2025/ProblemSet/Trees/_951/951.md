# Intuition and Approach for `flipEquiv` Function

## Intuition

The problem is to determine if two binary trees are flip equivalent. Two binary trees are considered flip equivalent if they are identical or can be made identical by flipping some of their subtrees. A flip operation consists of swapping the left and right children of a node.

The intuition behind the solutionUsingMapWithoutSort is to recursively check if the two trees are equivalent by comparing their root values and then checking their children in both flipped and non-flipped states.

## Approach

1. **Base Cases**:
    - If both `root1` and `root2` are `null`, they are trivially equivalent, so return `true`.
    - If one of the roots is `null` and the other is not, they cannot be equivalent, so return `false`.
    - If the values of `root1` and `root2` are different, they cannot be equivalent, so return `false`.

2. **Recursive Check**:
    - Check if the left subtree of `root1` is equivalent to the left subtree of `root2` and the right subtree of `root1` is equivalent to the right subtree of `root2` (non-flipped state).
    - If the above condition is `true`, return `true`.
    - Otherwise, check if the left subtree of `root1` is equivalent to the right subtree of `root2` and the right subtree of `root1` is equivalent to the left subtree of `root2` (flipped state).
    - Return the result of the flipped state check.

3. **Return Result**:
    - The function returns `true` if either the non-flipped or flipped state checks are `true`.

Here is the code with comments explaining each step:

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once during the recursive traversal.
### Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the binary tree. The recursive calls consume space on the call stack, which is proportional to the height of the tree.
