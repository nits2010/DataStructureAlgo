# Approach and Intuition

## Problem

Given a binary tree and a set of queries, determine the maximum height of the tree after removing the node specified in each query.

## Intuition-TLE

1. **Height Calculation**: For each node in the binary tree, we need to calculate its height and store it along with its parent.
2. **Query Execution**: For each query, calculate the height of the tree after removing the specified node by traversing from the node to the root, updating heights as needed.

## Approach

1. **Data Structures**:
    - `Map<Integer, Pair>`: Stores each node's parent and height.
    - `Pair`: Custom class to store parent node and height information.

2. **Steps**:
    - **Height Calculation (`O(N)`)**:
        - Traverse the tree and compute the height of each node.
        - Store the height and parent of each node in the map.
    - **Query Execution (`O(Q*H)`)**:
        - For each query, traverse from the node to the root.
        - Update the new height by considering the other child of the parent node.

3. **Detailed Execution**:
    - **Height Calculation**:
        - Use a recursive function to calculate the height of each node and store the height and parent information in the map.
    - **Query Execution**:
        - For each node in the query array, compute the new height by traversing from the node to the root.
        - Update the height based on whether the node is a left or right child of its parent.

## Time Complexity

- **Height Calculation**: `O(N)`
- **Query Execution**: `O(Q * H)`, where `Q` is the number of queries and `H` is the height of the tree.


The above solutionUsingMapWithoutSort has a time complexity of `O(N + Q * H)` which is TLE as the constraints of the problem
`2 <= n <= 10^5`
`1 <= m <= min(n, 10^4)`

That makes calculating the answer `10^5 * 10^4 = 10^9 > 10^8 (1sec)`.

Approach 5: Two Largest Cousins
Is an alluring approach which is based on the level of node and its depth. Here is a good explanation of this [approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY4bCorJH4g&t=12s).
