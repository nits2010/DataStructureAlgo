### Intuition and Approach for `replaceValueInTree`

## Intuition-TwoPass

### 1. BFS
The goal is to replace the value of each node in a binary tree with the sum of all its cousins' node values at its level. This requires two main steps:
1. Calculate the sum of node values for each level of the tree. AKA levelSum
2. Replace each node's value with the computed level sum minus the sum of its sibling node values.

#### Approach
1. **Calculate Level Sums**:
    - Perform a level order traversal (BFS) to calculate the sum of node values for each level.
    - Use a queue to traverse the tree level by level.
    - For each level, calculate the sum of node values and store it in a list (`levelSum`).

2. **Replace Node Values**:
    - Perform another level order traversal (BFS) to replace each node's value.
    - For each node, compute the sibling sum (sum of values of left and right children).
    - Replace the node's value with the level sum minus the sibling sum.
    - Update the node values accordingly.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node in the tree exactly once.
- Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We store the level sum in a list and the queue to store the nodes in the tree.



### 2. DFS
The goal is to replace the value of each node in a binary tree with the sum of all its cousins' node values at its level. This requires two main steps:
1. Calculate the sum of node values for each level of the tree aka levelSum using dfs. 
2. Replace each node's value with the computed level sum minus the sum of its sibling node values.

#### Approach
1. **Calculate Level Sums**:
    - Perform a dfs to calculate the sum of node values for each level.
    - For each level, calculate the sum of node values and store it in a list (`levelSum`).

2. **Replace Node Values**:
    - Perform another DFS to replace each node's value.
    - For each node, compute the sibling sum (sum of values of left and right children).
    - Replace the node's value with the level sum minus the sibling sum.
    - Update the node values accordingly.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node in the tree exactly once.
- Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We store the level sum in a list and the queue to store the nodes in the tree.



## Intuition-OnePass

### 1. BFS
In the two-pass BFS approach, the idea is to first calculate the sum of nodes at each level and then distribute that sum to update the node values in level order. Specifically, during the second pass, we distribute the sum to nodes at the next level, leveraging the previously computed sum for that level.

#### Key Idea:
Level Sum Calculation: While performing BFS, we can always compute two things:
- The current level's sum (sum of node values at the current level).
- The next level's sum (sum of node values at the next level). 

After processing each level, we swap these sums, where the next level's sum becomes the current level's sum for the next iteration.

#### Challenge:
While updating the current node's value to its sibling sum, we face a problem: we only have a partial sum of the current level while still processing the current node.

#### Solution:
To solve this, we cache the sibling sum at each node during the current level pass. Then, in the next level pass, we use this cached sibling sum to update the current node while traversing the next level. This ensures that each node gets replaced with the correct sibling sum without disrupting the traversal process.

#### Approach
1. **Initialize Queue**:
    - Use a queue (`q`) to facilitate level-order traversal (BFS) of the tree.
    - Start by offering the root node to the queue.
    - Initialize `currentLevelSum` with the root's value.

2. **Acquire Level Sums**:
    - For each level, compute the sum of the node values (`nextLevelSum`) and track the sum of sibling nodes for each node (`sibSum`).
    - Traverse each level using a loop. For each node in the level:
        - Update the node's value by subtracting its current value from `currentLevelSum`.
        - Calculate the sum of the node's children (`sibSum`) and add it to `nextLevelSum`.
        - Offer the children nodes to the queue while caching their sibling sum (`sibSum`) at each node.

3. **Update Current Level Sum**:
    - After processing all nodes at the current level, update `currentLevelSum` to `nextLevelSum`.


### 2. DFS
Apply the same logic as one-pass-bfs. The only challange we need to overcome is that, how to get the next level for dfs at the current level so that we can calculate the 
next level sum in hand. 
The one possible way is to cache the next Level nodes in a list and then process them while calculating a current level sum. 

#### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
    - Create a list (`levelNodes`) to hold nodes of the current level under processing.
    - Add the root node to this list.
    - Call the helper function `dfsAcquireDistributeSum` to process the current level and distribute sums.

2. **DFS to Acquire and Distribute Sum**:
    - **Base Case**: If there are no more nodes to process (i.e., `levelNodes` is empty), return.
    - **Process Current Level**:
        - Initialize `currentLevelSum` to store the sum of node values at the current level.
        - Create a list (`nextLevelNodes`) to cache the nodes of the next level for future processing.
        - Traverse the current level nodes and compute `currentLevelSum`.
        - Add the left and right children of each node to `nextLevelNodes`.
    - **Update Current Level Nodes**:
        - For each node in the current level, compute the sum of its sibling nodes (`sibSum`).
        - Update the value of the left and right children by subtracting `sibSum` from `currentLevelSum`.
    - **Recursive Call**:
        - Recursively call `dfsAcquireDistributeSum` for the next level nodes.

3. **Set Root Value**:
    - Set the root node's value to `0` since it has no siblings.

4. **Return Updated Tree**:

Please note, even though we are doing only single pass, but we are actually touching the same nodes `2 times`.
