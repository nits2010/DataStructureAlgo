### Intuition, Approach, and Explanation for `canAttendMeetings`

#### Intuition
The goal is to determine if a person can attend all given meetings without any overlaps. If any two meetings overlap, it means the person cannot attend all meetings.

#### Approach
1. **Edge Case Handling**:
    - If the interval array is `null` or contains one or zero intervals, return `true` as there are no overlaps possible.

2. **Sort Intervals**:
    - Sort the intervals based on their start times. This allows us to easily check for overlaps between consecutive intervals.

3. **Check for Overlaps**:
    - Iterate through the sorted intervals and check if the end time of the current interval is greater than the start time of the next interval.
    - If any overlap is found, return `false`.

4. **Return Result**:
    - If no overlaps are found during the iteration, return `true`.

#### Why It Works
- **Sorting**: By sorting the intervals by their start times, we ensure that any potential overlaps will be adjacent, simplifying the check for overlaps.
- **Efficient Checking**: By iterating through the sorted intervals once, we can efficiently determine if any overlaps exist, ensuring a linear time complexity after sorting.
