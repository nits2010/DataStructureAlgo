# Intuition
The problem you're solving is about grouping intervals such that no two intervals in the same group overlap. The goal is to determine the minimum number of such groups required.

### How/Why Do Intervals Overlap?
Intervals overlap when the end of the first interval is greater than or equal to the start of the second interval.

**Example**:
- Interval `a = [1, 5]` and `b = [2, 3]` are overlapping because `a[1] = 5` is greater than or equal to `b[0] = 2`.

If we draw these intervals on a number line, it looks like this:

`----1----2----3----5` 

`a[0] b[0] b[1] a[1]`


Here, the intervals overlap because `[2, 3]` is part of both intervals.

On the other hand, `a = [1, 5]` and `b = [6, 8]` are not overlapping because no time is shared between them:

`----1----5----6----8`

`a[0] a[1] b[0] b[1]`


### What Can We Conclude?
Now that we understand why intervals overlap, one takeaway is that it does not matter whether we exchange the start and end times of one interval with another.
The core of the problem is determining the maximum number of overlapping intervals at any given point. 
These overlapping intervals define the minimum number of groups required. 
Once we find the number of intervals that overlap at the same point, we can allocate non-overlapping intervals into existing groups.

**Example**:
- Interval `a = [1, 5]` and `b = [2, 3]`: If we swap the start and end times, we get `start = [1, 2]` and `end = [3, 5]`. We still need two groups to separate the original intervals because the new intervals `x = [1, 3]` and `y = [2, 5]` still overlap.

However, in another case:
- Interval `a = [1, 5]` and `b = [6, 8]`: If we swap the start and end times, `start = [1, 6]` and `end = [5, 8]`. In this case, we can accommodate both intervals in one group because the new intervals `x = [1, 5]` and `y = [6, 8]` do not overlap.

# Approach
1. Extract the start and end times of each interval.
2. Sort the start times and end times.
3. Check if the start time of the current interval is greater than the end time of the previous interval.
4. If it is, they can  be in the same group, so check for next intervals.
5. Otherwise, they cannot be in the same group. 


### Why This Works:
The solutionMimicPQ works because sorting the start and end times allows you to track the flow of intervals over time. When the start of a 
new interval is greater than the current earliest end time, you know that you can reuse a group since there’s no overlap. 
Otherwise, if there’s an overlap, you need a new group. The two-pointer technique efficiently tracks this by checking each 
start time against the earliest possible end time.
