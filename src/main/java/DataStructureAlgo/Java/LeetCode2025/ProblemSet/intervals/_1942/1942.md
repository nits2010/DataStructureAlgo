### Intuition, Approach, and Explanation for `smallestChair`

#### Intuition
The task is to find the first available chair for a given friend and ensure they sit on it. 
Once the friend leaves, the chair becomes available again. The challenge is to efficiently track the smallest numbered available chair. 
Also, we need to make sure that we also manage the friend leaving time as well, as soon as their window is over. 

#### Approach - 2 PQ
 The challenge is to efficiently track the smallest numbered available chair.
This can be managed using a min-heap (priority queue) to keep the chairs sorted by their availability. Similarly, to make sure to vacate all the chair by the time
a new friend comes, can also be managed by minHeap as we need to make sure that all the chairs get vacated by the time a new friend comes is by the earlier 
friend leaving time only. 

1. **Initialization**:
    - **Priority Queues**: Use two priority queues:
        - `occupiedChairs`: Tracks occupied chairs and their leave times.
        - `availableChairs`: Tracks available chairs in sorted order.
    - **Populate Available Chairs**: Initialize `availableChairs` with all chair numbers from 0 to n-1.
    - **Sort Arrival Times**: Sort the `times` array by earliest arrival time.

2. **Processing**:
    - Traverse through the sorted `times` array.
    - For each time:
        - Check if any friend is leaving their chair (`occupiedChairs`). If yes, remove the chair from `occupiedChairs` and add it to `availableChairs`.
        - Assign the smallest available chair to the current friend and update `occupiedChairs`.
        - If the current friend is the `targetFriend`, return the chair number.

3. **Return**:
    - Return the chair number assigned to `targetFriend`.

#### Why It Works
- **Min-Heap Efficiency**: Using a min-heap ensures that retrieving the smallest available chair is efficient (O(log n)).
- **Sorted Processing**: Sorting the times ensures we process arrivals in order, which aligns with real-time chair assignment.
- **Dynamic Management**: The use of two priority queues allows dynamic management of occupied and available chairs, ensuring efficient and correct chair assignment and reassignment.
