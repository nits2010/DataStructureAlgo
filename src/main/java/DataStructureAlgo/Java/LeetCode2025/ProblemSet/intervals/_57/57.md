### Intuition, Approach, and Explanation for `insert`
[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/solutions/5907074/simple-solution-detailed-explanation)
#### Intuition
The goal is to insert a new interval into a list of non-overlapping intervals while maintaining their sorted order and merging any overlapping intervals. By iterating through the intervals and handling the new interval appropriately, we can achieve this efficiently.

The position of new interval can be at `0th` index, `nth` index or anywhere `in between`.
1. if this is at `0th` index, then we need to add a new interval at first and merge all remaining intervals if needed
2. if this is at `nth` index, then we need to merge it with the last interval only. 
3. if this is `in between`, then we need to copy all non-overlapping intervals ( interval which came already) and
merge all the remaining intervals if necessary, post adding. 


#### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
    - If the input list of intervals is null or empty, return the new interval as the only element in the list.
    - Initialize a list to store the resulting intervals and determine the number of existing intervals (`n`).

2. **Add Intervals Before New Interval**:
    - Iterate through the existing intervals and add all intervals that come before the new interval to the result list.

3. **Merge or Add New Interval**:
    - If the result list is empty after processing intervals before the new interval, add the new interval as the first element.
    - Check if the last interval in the result list can be merged with the new interval:
        - If they overlap, merge them.
        - If they do not overlap, add the new interval to the result list.

4. **Add Remaining Intervals**:
    - Continue iterating through the remaining existing intervals:
        - If the current interval can be merged with the last interval in the result list, merge them.
        - If they do not overlap, add the current interval to the result list.

5. **Return Result**:
    - Convert the result list to an array and return it.

#### Why It Works
- **Efficient Processing**: By iterating through the intervals once and handling intervals before, during, and after the new interval appropriately, the approach efficiently manages interval insertion and merging.
- **Merge Function**: The merge function ensures that overlapping intervals are correctly combined by updating the start and end points.
- **Sorted Order Maintenance**: By handling intervals in the order they appear and maintaining the sorted order, the approach guarantees that the resulting intervals are non-overlapping and correctly ordered.

# Complexity
### Time complexity: 
O(n) where `n` is the number of intervals in the input list.

### Space complexity: 
O(n) where `n` is the number of intervals in the input list.
