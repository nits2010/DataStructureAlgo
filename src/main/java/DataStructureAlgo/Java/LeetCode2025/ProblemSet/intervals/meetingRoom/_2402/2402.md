## Problem: Meeting Room Allocation

### Problem Overview

We are given **n** meeting rooms numbered from **0 to n-1**, and a list of meetings with start and end times. The rules for assigning rooms are:

1. **Use the unused room with the lowest room number**.
2. **If no rooms are available**, the meeting is **delayed** until a room becomes available.
3. **If multiple rooms become available simultaneously**, pick the room with the **lowest room number**.
4. **If multiple meetings are delayed**, prioritize the one with the **earliest original start time**.
5. At the end, return the **room that hosted the maximum number of meetings**.

---

### Observations and Requirements

- Meetings must be processed in the order of their **start times**.
- We need an efficient way to find the **lowest numbered available room**.
- We need to track the **end time** of meetings for each room.
- We need a **counter** for each room to track how many meetings it hosted.

### Initial Approach (Naive)

1. **Sort** the meetings by start time.
2. Use an **array** to track the **end time** of meetings for each room.
3. To allocate a room:
    - Scan the array to find the **lowest indexed available room**.
    - If none are available, find the room with the **earliest end time**, delay the meeting, and allocate that room once it’s free.
4. Maintain a **counter array** to track the number of meetings held in each room.
5. Finally, return the index of the room with the **maximum meeting count**.

#### Time Complexity:
- **Room scanning** takes O(n) time per meeting → Total: O(m × n), where m = number of meetings

### Optimization (Using Min-Heap)

- **Use a Min-Heap** (priority queue) to track:
    - Rooms that are currently in use
    - Sort by **meeting end time**, and **room index** for tie-breaking
- Maintain another Min-Heap for **available rooms**, sorted by **room index**
- When a meeting starts:
    - Free up rooms whose meetings have ended (based on current start time) `usedRooms.peek()[1] <= start` -> `availableRooms.offer(usedRooms.poll()[0])`
    - Use the **lowest indexed room** from the available heap, if available
    - if no room is available in available heap, then take from used heap. 
    - Update the end time with ether with current meeting end time or usedHeap.poll()[1]+= duration, if fetched from used heap
- Track the **count of meetings** per room

#### Advantages:
- Min-heap helps find the **earliest available room in O(1)**.
- Updating the heap when a room becomes used again takes **O(log n)**.
- Overall time complexity becomes **O(m log n)**, much better than naive O(m × n).

### Final Complexity

- **Time:** O(m log n) — due to heap operations per meeting
- **Space:** O(n) — to store room states and meeting counts
