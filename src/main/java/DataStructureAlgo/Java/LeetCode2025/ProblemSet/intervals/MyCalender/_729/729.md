# Pre-Read
This artical help you to build the logic from very basic solution to advance solution.

# Intuition
As described in question, any two interval/booking will be overlapping only if they share some common time.

Overlapping
```
Existing:    [10 ----------- 20)
New:                 [15 ----------- 25) 

Existing:    [10 ----------- 20)     [25 ----------- 30)
New:                           [21 ----------- 26)
```

Non-overlapping
```
Existing:    [10 ----------- 20)
New:                         [20 ----------- 30)

Existing:    [10 ----------- 20)
New:                          [21 ----------- 30)
```

Hence, if we keep the data in sorted manner, with start time, then we can find the overlapping booking's.

# Approach Using Simple Scan
We will create a list which keep bookings.
Before adding any booking, we will try to identify if they are overlapping or not.

Overlapping
```
Existing:    [10 ----------- 20)
New:                 [15 ----------- 25) 

Existing:    [10 ----------- 20)     [25 ----------- 30)
New:                           [21 ----------- 26)
```

As shown above, the overlapping booking [10, 20] [15, 25]
So if they overlape than, Max(exisitingStart, newStart) is always less then min(exisitingEnd, newEnd)

max(10,15) < min (20,25)
15 < 20

### Why Does This Work?
* If the maximum of the start times is less than the minimum of the end times, it means that there is a "common" time interval between the two events, indicating an overlap.
* If this condition is false (i.e., the maximum start time is greater than or equal to the minimum end time), then the events do not overlap.

        public boolean book(int start, int end) {
            if (list.isEmpty()) {

             */
            for (int[] existing : list) {
                int existingStart = existing[0];
                int existingEnd = existing[1];

                if (Math.max(existingStart, start) < Math.min(existingEnd, end)) return false;

            }

            /**

             * Math.min(existingEnd, end) = 20
             * => 20 < 20 (no overlap)
             */

            list.add(new int[]{start, end});
            return true;
        }

    }
}

```
# Approach Optimize scan with Binary Search
We can optimize the above solution by eliminating the linear search with binary search. List in java allow us to add any element at the required position. However, it ends up shifting all the element to right when inserting in b/w which makes its  $$O(n)$$
However, its worth to try the binary search.

We will apply binary search on the start time, and will try to find a position where the new booking might get added.


* Prev event overlapping with new event
```
                    0
Existing:    [10 ---left-------- 20)
New:                 [15 ----------- 25)
insertPos = 0
=> 15 < 20 (overlap exists)

```

```
if (insertPos > 0 && list.get(insertPos - 1)[1] > start)

```

* Next event overlapping with new event
```
                    0                       1
Existing:    [10 ----------- 20)     [25 ----------- 30)
New:                           [21 ----------- 26)
insertPos = 1
=> 25 < 26 (overlap exists)
```

```
if (insertPos < list.size() && list.get(insertPos)[0] < end)

# Approach Optimize insertion process in list using BST
The main problem in above binary search solution is that insertion taking O(n) time.
This can be improve by binary search tree.

* Build a binary search tree of a given interval based on start time. [sorting start time].
* A new interval can go either left side, if root's start > its end
* A new interval can go either right side, if root's end < its start
* If an interval overlaps with the root, then it won't go either left or right since either upcoming interval start is in between of current root or its end in between of current root.

- Time complexity:
  $$O(n)$$ as it can become skew BST

- Space complexity:
  $$O(n)$$

# Approach Optimize insert/find using Red-black tree: TreeMap
