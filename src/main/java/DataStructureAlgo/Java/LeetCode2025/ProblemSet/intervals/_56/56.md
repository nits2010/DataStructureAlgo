### Intuition, Approach, and Explanation for `merge`

#### Intuition
The objective is to merge overlapping intervals in a list of intervals. By sorting the intervals by their start time, we can then efficiently merge them by maintaining an ongoing list of merged intervals.

#### Approach
1. **Sorting**:
    - First, sort the intervals by their start time. This helps in easily identifying overlapping intervals since any overlapping intervals will now be adjacent.

2. **Merging Intervals**:
    - Initialize a list to store the merged intervals (`outputList`) and add the first interval to it.
    - Iterate through the sorted intervals:
        - Compare the current interval with the last merged interval.
        - If the current interval overlaps with the last merged interval (i.e., the end of the last merged interval is greater than or equal to the start of the current interval), merge them by updating the end of the last merged interval to be the maximum of the current interval's end and the last merged interval's end.
        - If the current interval does not overlap, add it to the list of merged intervals and update the last merged interval to be the current interval.

3. **Returning the Result**:
    - Convert the list of merged intervals to an array and return it.

#### Why It Works
- **Sorting by Start Time**: Sorting ensures that any overlapping intervals are adjacent, simplifying the merging process.
- **Efficient Merging**: By iterating through the sorted intervals and maintaining a list of merged intervals, we can merge overlapping intervals in linear time after sorting.
- **Result Construction**: The approach builds the result incrementally and directly, ensuring that all overlapping intervals are merged correctly.
