## Algorithm
Count misplaced ( and ) and eliminate all balanced one. 
- Check if the input string s is null or empty. If true, return 0.
- Initialize a character array stack with the length of s.
- Initialize top to -1 and closedCount to 0.
- Iterate through each character c in s:
    - If c is '(', increment top and set stack[top] to '('.
    - If c is ')':
      - If top is greater than or equal to 0, decrement top.
      - Otherwise, increment closedCount.
    - Return closedCount if top is -1, otherwise return top + closedCount + 1.
