The intuition behind this approach is that all elements before `A[i]` that are greater than `A[i]` cannot be part of the maximum width with `A[j]` if `A[x...i-1] > A[j]`. Similarly, all elements to the right of `A[j]` that are smaller than `A[j]` cannot be part of the maximum width with `A[j]`.

To maximize `j - i`, we need to ensure that `A[j]` is the largest element on the right side and `A[i]` is the smallest element on the left side. However, since there could be many such elements, we need to try to maximize the width by moving either `i` or `j`.


**For example**:

[9, 8,  1,  0,  1,  9,  4,  0,  4,  1]

LeftMin:
[9, 8,  1,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0]

rightMax:
[9, 9,  9,  9,  9,  9,  4,  4,  4,  1]

| Step | Left | Right | MaxWidth | Condition                           |
|------|------|-------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| 1    | 0    | 0     | 0        | `leftMin == rightMax => 9 == 9` |
| 2    | 0    | 1     | 1        | `leftMin == rightMax => 9 <= 9` |
| 3    | 0    | 2     | 2        | `leftMin == rightMax => 9 <= 9` |
| 4    | 0    | 3     | 3        | `leftMin == rightMax => 9 <= 9` |
| 5    | 0    | 4     | 4        | `leftMin == rightMax => 9 <= 9` |
| 6    | 0    | 5     | 5        | `leftMin == rightMax => 9 <= 9` |
| 7    | 0    | 6     | 6        | `leftMin == rightMax => 9 <= 4` |
| 8    | 1    | 6     | 6        | `leftMin == rightMax => 8 <= 4` |
| 9    | 2    | 6     | 6        | `leftMin == rightMax => 1 <= 4` |
| 10   | 2    | 7     | 6        | `leftMin == rightMax => 1 <= 4` |
| 11   | 2    | 8     | 6        | `leftMin == rightMax => 1 <= 4` |
| 12   | 2    | 9     | 7        | `leftMin == rightMax => 1 <= 1` |

output : `7`
