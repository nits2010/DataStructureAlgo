# Intuition and Thought Process

## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed m x n matrix grid consisting of positive integers. You can start at any cell in the first column of the matrix and traverse the grid in the following way:
- From a cell (row, col), you can move to any of the cells: (row - 1, col + 1), (row, col + 1), and (row + 1, col + 1) such that the value of the cell you move to should be strictly bigger than the value of the current cell.
- Return the maximum number of moves that you can perform.

## Intuition

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: Use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of moves starting from cell (i, j).

2. **Traversal Logic**: From any cell, check the three possible next cells (up-right, right, down-right) to move to a cell with a strictly larger value.

3. **State Transition**:
    - If moving to a cell with a larger value is possible, update the DP value for the current cell by taking the maximum of the possible moves from the next cell plus one.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Define a 2D DP array `dp` with dimensions matching the input matrix, initialized to -1 to represent uncomputed states.

2. **Recursive Function**:
    - Implement a recursive function `maxMoves(i, j)` to calculate the maximum moves starting from cell (i, j).
    - Use memoization to store the computed values in the DP array.

3. **Boundary Check**:
    - Ensure the next cell is within bounds and has a larger value than the current cell before making a move.

4. **Iterate from First Column**:
    - Iterate through all cells in the first column and calculate the maximum moves starting from each of them.
    - Return the maximum value obtained from these calculations.

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the input matrix.
- Space Complexity: O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the input matrix.
