# [363. Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-sum-of-rectangle-no-larger-than-k/description/)

## Intution
The intuition of this problem is the same as [27.md](..%2F_gfg%2F_27%2F27.md). The only change here is that, instead of finding a submatrix/rectangle having a maximum sum
now we need to find a rectangle having maximum sum less than or equal to `k`.

This makes further extension in Kadane's Algorithm. So instead of finding the maximum subarray, now we just need to find a subarray that has maximum sum less than or equal to `k`.

## How do we find a subarray that has maximum sum less than or equal to `k`?
Just like as kadane's algorithm, we need to find the maximum sum subarray. However, during this process, we need to see if we have seen any subarray, that has a sum greater than or equal to `currentSum - k`. 
This is because, a sum that has been seen already which is greater than or equal to `currentSum - k` will definitely make our overall sum <= k by `currentSum - X` where X is the sum greater than or equal to `currentSum - k`.

For example, assume there is a sum that is equal to `currentSum - k` say X. That means if we do currentSum - X then it will be K only. 
```
X = currentSum - k
finalSum = currentSum - X
         = currentSum - (currentSum - k)
         = k
        
```
hence finding such value `X >= (currentSum - k)` will make equation as below 

```
X >= (currentSum - k)
finalSum = currentSum - X
         = currentSum - (currentSum - k) <=k
 finalSum <=k
``` 
To find such `X` we can use binary search. The celling value of `currentSum - k` is our X. To simplify this, we can use inbuild data structure `SortedSet` / `TreeSet`.

#### Algorithm

1. **Initialize Variables**:
    - `row`: Number of rows in the matrix.
    - `col`: Number of columns in the matrix.
    - `maxSum`: Variable to store the maximum sum found, initialized to the smallest possible integer.
    - `temp`: Array to store the sum of elements between two columns for each row.

2. **Iterate Over Pairs of Columns**:
    - For each pair of columns (`leftCol` and `rightCol`):
        - Reset the `temp` array to zero.
        - For each column between `leftCol` and `rightCol`, add the column's values to the `temp` array.
        - Calculate the maximum subarray sum for the `temp` array that is no larger than `k` using the helper function `kadans1D`.

3. **Kadane's Algorithm with a Twist**:
    - Use a modified Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of subarray no larger than `k`:
        - Initialize a `TreeSet` to store the prefix sums.
        - Traverse through the `temp` array, updating the current sum and checking if there exists a prefix sum such that `currentSum - prefixSum <= k`.
        - If such a prefix sum exists, update `maxSum`.

4. **Return Result**:
    - Return the maximum sum found.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity `O(col^2 * row * log(row))`
1. **Iterating Over Columns**:
    - The outer loop iterates over `col` columns for `leftCol`.
    - The inner loop iterates over columns from `leftCol` to `col` for `rightCol`.
    - Combined, these loops run in `O(col^2)`.

2. **Updating the Temp Array**:
    - For each pair of `leftCol` and `rightCol`, we iterate over `row` rows to update the `temp` array.
    - This step runs in `O(row * col^2)` for the worst case.

3. **Kadane's Algorithm with TreeSet**:
    - The `kadans1D` function iterates over the `temp` array of length `row`.
    - Operations with the `TreeSet` involve inserting and searching, both of which are `O(log row)` operations.
    - Thus, the `kadans1D` function runs in `O(row * log(row))`.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is: `O(col^2 * row * log(row))`


#### Space Complexity : `O(row}`
1. **Temp Array**:
    - The `temp` array stores sums for `row` elements, so it uses `O(row)` space.

2. **TreeSet**:
    - The `TreeSet` can contain up to `row` elements during its operations, so it uses `O(row}` space as well.
