# Intuition, Approach, Complexity, and Example

## Problem Statement

Given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the i-th day, and an integer `k`, find the maximum profit you can achieve with at most `k` transactions. 
You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Intuition

- `profit[t][i]` represents the profit on the `i`-th day by doing `t` transactions.
- On the `i`-th day, we have two choices:
    1. Do not do any transaction on the `i`-th day. This means the profit remains the same as the previous day for this transaction level, i.e., `profit[t][i-1]`.
    2. If we are making a transaction on the `i`-th day, we need to find the minimum value in the range `[0...i-1]` (denoted as `j`) such that `prices[i] > prices[j]`. This involves:
    - Buying the stock on the `j`-th day and selling on the `i`-th day.
    - We also need the profit from the day of the last transaction, which is `profit[t-1][j]`.

- Therefore, to make a transaction on the `i`-th day, we need to compute:
    - `max(prices[i] - prices[j] + profit[t-1][j])` for all `j` in the range `[0...i-1]`.
    - This can be rewritten as `max(profit[t-1][j] - prices[j]) + prices[i]` since `prices[i]` is constant for all `j` in the range `[0...i-1]`.
    - Essentially, `max(profit[t-1][j] - prices[j])` is finding the maximum profit for `j` in the range `[0..i-1]`.

- Hence, the final formula is:
    - `profit[t][i] = max(profit[t][i-1], max(profit[t-1][j] - prices[j]) + prices[i])`.

- Since we are only using two rows at a time, we can reduce the space complexity to constant:
    - `profit[1][i] = max(profit[1][i-1], max(profit[0][j] - prices[j]) + prices[i])`.

- For each subsequent transaction, copy `profit[1][i]` to `profit[0][i]`.

## Optimization Insight

- By closely examining the profit table, we observe that if `t > n/2`, then it is not feasible to perform more transactions than half the available days. Essentially, we cannot make three transactions if we only have stock prices for two days.

- Therefore, if we have `n` days of stock prices, the maximum number of transactions we can perform is `n/2`.

- For example, if `n = 4` and the stock prices are `[1, 4, 3, 6]`, we can perform at most 2 transactions:
    - Buy at 1 and sell at 4, then buy at 3 and sell at 6.
    - Alternatively, buy at 1 and sell at 6.
    - We will choose 2 transactions if it yields more profit.

- Thus, if `k >= n/2`, set `k = n/2`


## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(k * n)`, where `k` is the number of transactions and `n` is the number of days.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, for the DP array used to store profits.

|--------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Initialization | `[3, 2, 6, 5, 0, 3]` | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` | Initialize DP arrays                          |
| Transaction 1| `[3, 2, 6, 5, 0, 3]` | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` | `[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]` | Update profits for first transaction          |
| Transaction 2| `[3, 2, 6, 5, 0, 3]` | `[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4]`
