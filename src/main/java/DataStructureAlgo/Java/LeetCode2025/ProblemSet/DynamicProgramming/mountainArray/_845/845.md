# Intuition, Thought Process, and Approach

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest mountain. A mountain array is defined as an array that has at least three elements, and there exists some index i such that:
- `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i]`
- `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[end]`

## Intuition

1. **Mountain Characteristics**: A mountain must have a peak where elements before the peak are in strictly increasing order, and elements after the peak are in strictly decreasing order.
2. **Single Pass with Two Pointers**: Using two pointers (start and end), traverse the array to identify mountain sequences. Keep track of the maximum length of these sequences.

## Thought Process

1. **Initialization**:
    - Initialize `max` to track the maximum length of the mountain.
    - Use `start` and `end` pointers to traverse the array.

2. **Traverse the Array**:
    - Start from the second element and iterate through the array.
    - Check for the start of an increasing sequence.
    - Continue until the sequence stops increasing and check if it transitions to a decreasing sequence.
    - Continue until the sequence stops decreasing.
    - Calculate the length of the mountain and update `max` if it's greater than the current `max`.

3. **Edge Case**:
    - If no valid mountain is found, return 0.
    - A valid mountain must be at least 3 elements long.

## Approach

1. **Two Pointers**:
    - Use `start` to mark the beginning of a potential mountain.
    - Use `end` to traverse the array and find valid mountains.

2. **Increasing Sequence**:
    - From any element `arr[end - 1] < arr[end]`, mark it as the beginning of a potential mountain.

3. **Decreasing Sequence**:
    - Continue the sequence if `arr[end - 1] > arr[end]`.

4. **Max Length Calculation**:
    - Calculate the length of each valid mountain and update the maximum length.

5. **Return the Maximum Length**:

## Complexity

- Time: **O(n)**
- Space: **O(1)**
