### `MKAverage_UsingTreeMap` Explanation

---

## üß† Intuition

To calculate the MK Average (average after removing the smallest `k` and largest `k` elements from the latest `m` elements), we need a data structure that supports:

* Maintaining order of insertion (to discard the oldest),
* Efficient insertion and deletion in sorted order,
* Efficient access to the smallest and largest `k` elements.

We divide the most recent `m` elements into three parts:

* **Left (left)**: The smallest `k` elements.
* **Right (right)**: The largest `k` elements.
* **Mid (mid)**: The middle `m - 2k` elements, from which we compute the sum and average.

We maintain three `TreeMap<Integer, Integer>` (multisets) and a queue to manage the window of `m` elements.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm

### Initialization

* Initialize a queue to store the last `m` elements.
* Initialize three TreeMaps:

    * `left` for smallest `k` elements.
    * `mid` for middle `m - 2k` elements.
    * `right` for largest `k` elements.
* Maintain the sizes of left and right explicitly (`leftSize`, `rightSize`).
* Maintain a running `sum` of the `mid` elements.

### `addElement(num)`

1. Add `num` to the queue.
2. Place `num` into `left`, `right`, or `mid` based on value:

    * If `num` <= `left.lastKey()`, it belongs to `left`.
    * Else if `num` >= `right.firstKey()`, it belongs to `right`.
    * Otherwise, add to `mid` and update `sum`.
3. If queue size > `m`, remove the oldest element:

    * Remove from one of the three multisets and update size/sum accordingly.
4. Balance the sets:

    * Ensure `left` and `right` have exactly `k` elements:

        * If they exceed `k`, move elements to `mid` and update `sum`.
        * If they are under `k`, pull from `mid` and update `sum`.

### `calculateMKAverage()`

* If the queue has < `m` elements, return `-1`.
* Else return `sum / (m - 2k)` as the MK Average.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity

Let `n` be the number of elements added:

* `addElement(num)`: Each insertion and deletion in `TreeMap` is `O(log k)`.
* Balancing operations are `O(log k)` in worst case per insertion.
* So, each call to `addElement` is `O(log k)`.
* `calculateMKAverage()`: `O(1)`.

### Overall:

* `addElement`: `O(log k)`
* `calculateMKAverage`: `O(1)`

---

## üìä Space Complexity

* O(m): for the queue of size `m`.
* O(k): each for `left` and `right`.
* O(m - 2k): for `mid`.
* So total space = O(m).

## üîç Example

```
MKAverage obj = new MKAverage(3, 1);
obj.addElement(3);
obj.addElement(1);
obj.calculateMKAverage(); // returns -1 (less than m elements)
obj.addElement(10);
obj.calculateMKAverage(); // returns 3 (remove min=1 and max=10, average = 3)
```
