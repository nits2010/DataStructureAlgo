## Intuition - PQ

The goal is to construct the longest possible string using the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' such that no three consecutive characters are the same. This problem can be approached using a greedy algorithm with a priority queue to always select the character with the highest remaining count, ensuring the constraints are met.

## Approach

1. **Define a Pair Class**: This class holds a character and its count.
2. **Initialize Priority Queue**: Use a max-heap (priority queue) to always fetch the character with the highest count.
3. **Add Characters to Queue**: Add 'a', 'b', and 'c' to the queue if their counts are greater than zero.
4. **Build the String**:
    - Poll the character with the highest count from the queue.
    - Check if adding this character would violate the constraint (i.e., it would be the same as the last two characters in the string).
    - If it violates the constraint, poll the next highest character and use it instead.
    - Append the chosen character to the string and decrease its count.
    - Reinsert the character back into the queue if its count is still greater than zero.
5. **Return the Result**: Once the queue is empty, return the constructed string.


## Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example with `a = 6`, `b = 1`, and `c = 1`.

| Iteration | Action Taken | String (`s`) | Remaining Counts | Priority Queue |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1         | Poll `a` (6)  | `a`          | `a: 5, b: 1, c: 1` | `[(a, 5), (b, 1), (c, 1)]` |
| 2         | Poll `a` (5)  | `aa`         | `a: 4, b: 1, c: 1` | `[(a, 4), (b, 1), (c, 1)]` |
| 3         | Poll `a` (4)  | `aa` (violation) | `a: 4, b: 1, c: 1` | `[(b, 1), (c, 1)]` |
| 3         | Poll `b` (1)  | `aab`        | `a: 4, b: 0, c: 1` | `[(a, 4), (c, 1)]` |
| 4         | Poll `a` (4)  | `aaba`       | `a: 3, b: 0, c: 1` | `[(a, 3), (c, 1)]` |
| 5         | Poll `a` (3)  | `aabaa`      | `a: 2, b: 0, c: 1` | `[(a, 2), (c, 1)]` |
| 6         | Poll `a` (2)  | `aabaa` (violation) | `a: 2, b: 0, c: 1` | `[(c, 1)]` |
| 6         | Poll `c` (1)  | `aabaac`     | `a: 2, b: 0, c: 0` | `[(a, 2)]` |
| 7         | Poll `a` (2)  | `aabaaca`    | `a: 1, b: 0, c: 0` | `[(a, 1)]` |
| 8         | Poll `a` (1)  | `aabaacaa`   | `a: 0, b: 0, c: 0` | `[]` |

**Result**: The final string is `"aabaacaa"`.


This approach ensures that the longest possible string is constructed while adhering to the constraint of no three consecutive characters being the same.

## Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) PQ is constant size


## Intuition - Mimic PQ

The goal is to construct the longest possible string using the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' such that no three consecutive characters are the same. This problem can be approached using a greedy algorithm that mimics a priority queue to always select the character with the highest remaining count, ensuring the constraints are met.

## Approach

1. **Define a Pair Class**: This class holds a character and its count.
2. **Poll Function**: A custom function to select the character with the highest count, excluding a specified character if needed.
3. **Check Empty Function**: A function to check if all characters are exhausted, optionally excluding a specified character.
4. **Initialize Pairs**: Create pairs for 'a', 'b', and 'c' with their respective counts.
5. **Build the String**:
   - Use the `poll` function to select the character with the highest count.
   - Check if adding this character would violate the constraint (i.e., it would be the same as the last two characters in the string).
   - If it violates the constraint, use the `poll` function to select the next highest character.
   - Append the chosen character to the string and decrease its count.
6. **Return the Result**: Once all characters are exhausted, return the constructed string.

## Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example with `a = 6`, `b = 1`, and `c = 1`.

| Iteration | Action Taken | String (`s`) | Remaining Counts | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| 1         | Poll `a` (6)  | `a`          | `a: 5, b: 1, c: 1` |      |
| 2         | Poll `a` (5)  | `aa`         | `a: 4, b: 1, c: 1` |      |
| 3         | Poll `a` (4)  | `aa` (violation) | `a: 4, b: 1, c: 1` | Poll `b` (1) |
| 3         | Poll `b` (1)  | `aab`        | `a: 4, b: 0, c: 1` |      |
| 4         | Poll `a` (4)  | `aaba`       | `a: 3, b: 0, c: 1` |      |
| 5         | Poll `a` (3)  | `aabaa`      | `a: 2, b: 0, c: 1` |      |
| 6         | Poll `a` (2)  | `aabaa` (violation) | `a: 2, b: 0, c: 1` | Poll `c` (1) |
| 6         | Poll `c` (1)  | `aabaac`     | `a: 2, b: 0, c: 0` |      |
| 7         | Poll `a` (2)  | `aabaaca`    | `a: 1, b: 0, c: 0` |      |
| 8         | Poll `a` (1)  | `aabaacaa`   | `a: 0, b: 0, c: 0` |      |

**Result**: The final string is `"aabaacaa"`.

This approach ensures that the longest possible string is constructed while adhering to the constraint of no three consecutive characters being the same.



## Intuition - Optimal Greedy

The goal is to construct the longest possible string using the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' such that no three consecutive characters are the same. This problem can be approached using a simple greedy algorithm that iteratively selects the character with the highest remaining count, ensuring the constraints are met.

## Approach

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `StringBuilder s`: To build the resulting string.
   - `maxResultSize`: The total number of characters to be used (`a + b + c`).
   - Counters for consecutive characters: `continuousA`, `continuousB`, `continuousC`.
   - A boolean flag `choose` to track if a character was chosen in the current iteration.

2. **Iterate to Build the String**:
   - For each position in the result string (up to `maxResultSize`):
      - Check if 'a' can be added (not violating the constraint and having the highest count or other characters are exhausted).
      - If 'a' is chosen, append it to the string, decrement its count, and reset other counters.
      - Repeat the same logic for 'b' and 'c'.
      - If no character can be chosen without violating the constraint, break the loop.

3. **Return the Result**: Once the loop completes, return the constructed string.

## Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example with `a = 6`, `b = 1`, and `c = 1`.

| Iteration | Action Taken | String (`s`) | Remaining Counts | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| 1         | Choose `a`    | `a`          | `a: 5, b: 1, c: 1` | continuousA = 1 |
| 2         | Choose `a`    | `aa`         | `a: 4, b: 1, c: 1` | continuousA = 2 |
| 3         | Choose `b`    | `aab`        | `a: 4, b: 0, c: 1` | continuousA = 0, continuousB = 1 |
| 4         | Choose `a`    | `aaba`       | `a: 3, b: 0, c: 1` | continuousA = 1, continuousB = 0 |
| 5         | Choose `a`    | `aabaa`      | `a: 2, b: 0, c: 1` | continuousA = 2 |
| 6         | Choose `c`    | `aabaac`     | `a: 2, b: 0, c: 0` | continuousA = 0, continuousC = 1 |
| 7         | Choose `a`    | `aabaaca`    | `a: 1, b: 0, c: 0` | continuousA = 1, continuousC = 0 |
| 8         | Choose `a`    | `aabaacaa`   | `a: 0, b: 0, c: 0` | continuousA = 2 |

**Result**: The final string is `"aabaacaa"`.

This approach ensures that the longest possible string is constructed while adhering to the constraint of no three consecutive characters being the same.
