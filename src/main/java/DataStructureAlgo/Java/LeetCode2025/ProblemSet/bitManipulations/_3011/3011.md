#[3011. Find if Array Can Be Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-array-can-be-sorted/description/)

# Intuition
The number can only be sorted, if they form sorted array post shuffling.
Which gives us hint, how they get orgnized. If you notice, post sorting, assume there are group of different bits count, then last group max element can not be greater then next group min Element, because then only they will form a increasing order.

### Example
```
nums:     8,      4,    2,   30,       15
bits:     1000,   100,  10,  011110,   01111
bitCount: 1       1      1   4         4

```

We can clearly see that there is two groups, bit count = 1 and 4.
The first group is bitCount = 1 and has max = 8 and min = 2. Since this is the first group, then it always can form a increasing order [ last group is empty].

However, for next group (30,15) with bitCount = 4, the min = 15 and max = 30 and it does follow the increasing rule, as last group max = 8 and current group min = 15 and 8 < 15.


```
nums:     8,      4,    2,   14,       7
bits:     1000,   100,  10,  1110,   111
bitCount: 1       1      1   3        3

```

This can not, since last Group max = 8 and current Group min = 7 and 8 > 7.



# Approach
1. Keep track the group based on bitCount. Also track the min and max of that group.
2. Whenever a new group start, check does they following increasing order or not. if not, exit.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  $$O(n)$$

- Space complexity:
  $$O(1)$$
