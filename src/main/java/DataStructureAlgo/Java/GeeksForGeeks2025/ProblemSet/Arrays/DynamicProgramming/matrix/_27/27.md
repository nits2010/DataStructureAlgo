# Maximum Sum Rectangle in a 2D Matrix

## Problem Statement

The goal is to find a rectangular subarray with the maximum sum in a 2D matrix. A brute-force approach would involve iterating over all possible rectangles, computing their sums, and identifying the maximum. However, this approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2 \cdot m^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of rows and \(m\) is the number of columns, which is inefficient for larger matrices.

## Reducing the Problem to 1D

To optimize the solutionBFS, we can reduce the 2D problem to a series of 1D problems:

1. **Fix Two Row Boundaries (`top` and `bottom`)**:
    - For every pair of rows, collapse the submatrix between `top` and `bottom` into a 1D array. Each element in this array represents the sum of elements in a column for the fixed rows.

2. **Convert the 2D Problem into a 1D Subarray Problem**:
    - Once the 1D array is generated, finding the maximum sum rectangle becomes equivalent to finding the **maximum sum subarray** in this 1D array.

---

## Example

Consider the matrix:

```
 1   2  -1  -4  -20
-8  -3   4   2    1
 3   8  10   1    3
-4  -1   1   7   -6

```
For `top = 1` and `bottom = 3`, the 1D array is:
```
[(-8) + 3 + (-4), (-3) + 8 + (-1), (4) + 10 + 1, (2) + 1 + 7, (1) + 3 + (-6)] = [-9, 4, 15, 10, -2]
```

- The problem is now reduced to finding the **maximum sum subarray** of `[-9, 4, 15, 10, -2]`.

## Why Kadane's Algorithm?

Kadane’s algorithm efficiently finds the maximum sum subarray in \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the array. The key idea is to track the maximum sum while iterating through the array:

1. Consider whether adding the current element to the subarray increases the sum.
2. If not, reset the subarray to start at the current element.

By applying Kadane’s algorithm, the maximum sum for the current 1D array can be computed in linear time.

## Algorithm for the 2D Problem

1. **Initialize Variables**:
    - Let `maxSum` store the maximum sum found so far, initialized to a very small value.
    - Iterate over all possible pairs of rows (`top` and `bottom`).

2. **Generate a 1D Array**:
    - For each fixed pair of rows (`top` and `bottom`), create a temporary 1D array `temp` by summing elements column-wise between these rows.

3. **Apply Kadane's Algorithm**:
    - Use Kadane’s algorithm on the 1D array `temp` to find the maximum sum subarray for the current row range.
    - Update `maxSum` if this subarray sum is larger.

4. **Repeat**:
    - Iterate through all possible pairs of rows, applying the above steps.

5. **Return the Maximum Sum**:
    - After iterating through all pairs of rows, `maxSum` contains the result.

## Why Does This Work?

This approach works because:

1. **Collapsing Rows**:
    - By summing elements between two rows, we reduce the 2D matrix to a 1D problem for that row range.

2. **Kadane's Algorithm**:
    - Kadane's algorithm efficiently finds the maximum sum subarray, which represents the maximum rectangle sum for the current row range.

3. **Iterating Over Row Ranges**:
    - By considering all possible row ranges, the algorithm ensures that all potential rectangles are considered.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
    - Generating the 1D array for each pair of rows: `O(n^2 * m)`.
    - Applying Kadane’s algorithm on each 1D array:`O(n^2 * m)`.
    - Total:`O(n^2 * m)`.

- **Space Complexity**:
    - Temporary 1D array for storing column sums: `O(m)`.

This is a significant improvement over the brute-force `O(n^2 * m^2)` approach.

---

## Conclusion

By reducing the 2D problem to a series of 1D problems and leveraging Kadane’s algorithm, we achieve an efficient solutionBFS for finding the maximum sum rectangle in a 2D matrix.
